This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.",

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has proved to be an effective way of training deep networks, and SGD variants such as momentum (Sutskever et al., 2013) and Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) have been used to achieve state of the art performance. SGD optimizes the parameters \u0398 of the network, so as to\nProceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015. JMLR: W&CP volume 37. Copyright 2015 by the author(s).\nminimize the loss\n\u0398 = arg min \u0398\n1\nN N\u2211 i=1 `(xi,\u0398)\nwhere x1...N is the training data set. With SGD, the training proceeds in steps, at each step considering a minibatch x1...m of size m. Using mini-batches of examples, as opposed to one example at a time, is helpful in several ways. First, the gradient of the loss over a mini-batch 1 m \u2211m i=1 \u2202`(xi,\u0398) \u2202\u0398 is an estimate of the gradient over the training set, whose quality improves as the batch size increases. Second, computation over a mini-batch can be more efficient than m computations for individual examples on modern computing platforms.\nWhile stochastic gradient is simple and effective, it requires careful tuning of the model hyper-parameters, specifically the learning rate and the initial parameter values. The training is complicated by the fact that the inputs to each layer are affected by the parameters of all preceding layers \u2013 so that small changes to the network parameters amplify as the network becomes deeper.\nThe change in the distributions of layers\u2019 inputs presents a problem because the layers need to continuously adapt to the new distribution. When the input distribution to a learning system changes, it is said to experience covariate shift (Shimodaira, 2000). This is typically handled via domain adaptation (Jiang, 2008). However, the notion of covariate shift can be extended beyond the learning system as a whole, to apply to its parts, such as a sub-network or a layer. Consider a network computing\n` = F2(F1(u,\u03981),\u03982)\nwhere F1 and F2 are arbitrary transformations, and the parameters \u03981,\u03982 are to be learned so as to minimize the loss `. Learning \u03982 can be viewed as if the inputs x = F1(u,\u03981) are fed into the sub-network\n` = F2(x,\u03982).\nFor example, a gradient descent step\n\u03982 \u2190 \u03982 \u2212 \u03b1\nm m\u2211 i=1 \u2202F2(xi,\u03982) \u2202\u03982\n(for mini-batch sizem and learning rate \u03b1) is exactly equivalent to that for a stand-alone network F2 with input x. Therefore, the input distribution properties that aid the network generalization \u2013 such as having the same distribution between the training and test data \u2013 apply to training the sub-network as well. As such it is advantageous for the distribution of x to remain fixed over time. Then, \u03982 does not have to readjust to compensate for the change in the distribution of x.\nFixed distribution of inputs to a sub-network would have positive consequences for the layers outside the subnetwork, as well. Consider a layer with a sigmoid activation function z = g(Wu + b) where u is the layer input, the weight matrix W and bias vector b are the layer parameters to be learned, and g(x) = 11+exp(\u2212x) . As |x| increases, g\u2032(x) tends to zero. This means that for all dimensions of x = Wu + b except those with small absolute values, the gradient flowing down to u will vanish and the model will train slowly. However, since x is affected by W, b and the parameters of all the layers below, changes to those parameters during training will likely move many dimensions of x into the saturated regime of the nonlinearity and slow down the convergence. This effect is amplified as the network depth increases. In practice, the saturation problem and the resulting vanishing gradients are usually addressed by using Rectified Linear Units (Nair & Hinton, 2010) ReLU(x) = max(x, 0), careful initialization (Bengio & Glorot, 2010; Saxe et al., 2013), and small learning rates. If, however, we could ensure that the distribution of nonlinearity inputs remains more stable as the network trains, then the optimizer would be less likely to get stuck in the saturated regime, and the training would accelerate.\nWe refer to the change in the distributions of internal nodes of a deep network, in the course of training, as Internal Covariate Shift. Eliminating it offers a promise of faster training. We propose a new mechanism, which we call Batch Normalization, that takes a step towards reducing internal covariate shift, and in doing so dramatically accelerates the training of deep neural nets. It accomplishes this via a normalization step that fixes the means and variances of layer inputs. Batch Normalization also has a beneficial effect on the gradient flow through the network, by reducing the dependence of gradients on the scale of the parameters or of their initial values. This allows us to use much higher learning rates without the risk of divergence. Furthermore, batch normalization regularizes the model and reduces the need for Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014). Finally, Batch Normalization makes it possible to use saturating nonlin-\nearities by preventing the network from getting stuck in the saturated modes.\nIn Sec. 4.2, we apply Batch Normalization to the bestperforming ImageNet classification network, and show that we can match its performance using only 7% of the training steps, and can further exceed its accuracy by a substantial margin. Using an ensemble of such networks trained with Batch Normalization, we achieve the top-5 error rate that improves upon the best known results on ImageNet classification."

            "text": "We define Internal Covariate Shift as the change in the distribution of network activations due to the change in network parameters during training. To improve the training, we seek to reduce the internal covariate shift. By fixing the distribution of the layer inputs x as the training progresses, we expect to improve the training speed. It has been long known (LeCun et al., 1998b; Wiesler & Ney, 2011) that the network training converges faster if its inputs are whitened \u2013 i.e., linearly transformed to have zero means and unit variances, and decorrelated. As each layer observes the inputs produced by the layers below, it would be advantageous to achieve the same whitening of the inputs of each layer. By whitening the inputs to each layer, we would take a step towards achieving the fixed distributions of inputs that would remove the ill effects of the internal covariate shift.\nWe could consider whitening activations at every training step or at some interval, either by modifying the network directly or by changing the parameters of the optimization algorithm to depend on the network activation values (Wiesler et al., 2014; Raiko et al., 2012; Povey et al., 2014; Desjardins & Kavukcuoglu). However, if these modifications are interspersed with the optimization steps, then the gradient descent step may attempt to update the parameters in a way that requires the normalization to be updated, which reduces the effect of the gradient step. For example, consider a layer with the input u that adds the learned bias b, and normalizes the result by subtracting the mean of the activation computed over the training data: x\u0302 = x \u2212 E[x] where x = u + b, X = {x1...N} is the set of values of x over the training set, and E[x] = 1N \u2211N i=1 xi. If a gradient descent step ignores the dependence of E[x] on b, then it will update b \u2190 b + \u2206b, where \u2206b \u221d \u2212\u2202`/\u2202x\u0302. Then u+ (b+ \u2206b)\u2212E[u+ (b+ \u2206b)] = u+ b\u2212E[u+ b]. Thus, the combination of the update to b and subsequent change in normalization led to no change in the output of the layer nor, consequently, the loss. As the training continues, b will grow indefinitely while the loss remains fixed. This problem can get worse if the normalization not only centers but also scales the activations. We have observed this\nempirically in initial experiments, where the model blows up when the normalization parameters are computed outside the gradient descent step.\nThe issue with the above approach is that the gradient descent optimization does not take into account the fact that the normalization takes place. To address this issue, we would like to ensure that, for any parameter values, the network always produces activations with the desired distribution. Doing so would allow the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters to account for the normalization, and for its dependence on the model parameters \u0398. Let again x be a layer input, treated as a vector, and X be the set of these inputs over the training data set. The normalization can then be written as a transformation\nx\u0302 = Norm(x,X )\nwhich depends not only on the given training example x but on all examples X \u2013 each of which depends on \u0398 if x is generated by another layer. For backpropagation, we would need to compute the Jacobians \u2202Norm(x,X )\u2202x and \u2202Norm(x,X )\n\u2202X ; ignoring the latter term would lead to the explosion described above. Within this framework, whitening the layer inputs is expensive, as it requires computing the covariance matrix Cov[x] = Ex\u2208X [xxT ] \u2212 E[x]E[x]T and its inverse square root, to produce the whitened activations Cov[x]\u22121/2(x\u2212 E[x]), as well as the derivatives of these transforms for backpropagation. This motivates us to seek an alternative that performs input normalization in a way that is differentiable and does not require the analysis of the entire training set after every parameter update.\nSome of the previous approaches (e.g. (Lyu & Simoncelli, 2008)) use statistics computed over a single training example, or, in the case of image networks, over different feature maps at a given location. However, this changes the representation ability of a network by discarding the absolute scale of activations. We want to a preserve the information in the network, by normalizing the activations in a training example relative to the statistics of the entire training data."

The first is that instead of whitening the features in layer inputs and outputs jointly, we will normalize each scalar feature independently, by making it have zero mean and unit variance. For a layer with d-dimensional input x = (x(1) . . . x(d)), we will normalize each dimension\nx\u0302(k) = x(k) \u2212 E[x(k)]\u221a\nVar[x(k)]\nwhere the expectation and variance are computed over the training data set. As shown in (LeCun et al., 1998b), such\nnormalization speeds up convergence, even when the features are not decorrelated.\nNote that simply normalizing each input of a layer may change what the layer can represent. For instance, normalizing the inputs of a sigmoid would constrain them to the linear regime of the nonlinearity. To address this, we make sure that the transformation inserted in the network can represent the identity transform. To accomplish this, we introduce, for each activation x(k), a pair of parameters \u03b3(k), \u03b2(k), which scale and shift the normalized value:\ny(k) = \u03b3(k)x\u0302(k) + \u03b2(k).\nThese parameters are learned along with the original model parameters, and restore the representation power of the network. Indeed, by setting \u03b3(k) = \u221a Var[x(k)] and \u03b2(k) = E[x(k)], we could recover the original activations, if that were the optimal thing to do.\nIn the batch setting where each training step is based on the entire training set, we would use the whole set to normalize activations. However, this is impractical when using stochastic optimization. Therefore, we make the second simplification: since we use mini-batches in stochastic gradient training, each mini-batch produces estimates of the mean and variance of each activation. This way, the statistics used for normalization can fully participate in the gradient backpropagation. Note that the use of minibatches is enabled by computation of per-dimension variances rather than joint covariances; in the joint case, regularization would be required since the mini-batch size is likely to be smaller than the number of activations being whitened, resulting in singular covariance matrices.\nConsider a mini-batch B of sizem. Since the normalization is applied to each activation independently, let us focus on a particular activation x(k) and omit k for clarity. We have m values of this activation in the mini-batch,\nB = {x1...m}.\nLet the normalized values be x\u03021...m, and their linear transformations be y1...m.

The normalized activations x\u0302 are internal to our transformation, but their presence is crucial. The distributions of values of any x\u0302 has the expected value of 0 and the variance of 1, as long as the elements of each mini-batch are sampled from the same distribution, and if we neglect . This can be seen by observing that \u2211m i=1 x\u0302i = 0 and 1 m \u2211m i=1 x\u0302 2 i = 1, and taking expectations. Each normalized activation x\u0302(k) can be viewed as an input to a sub-network composed of the linear transform y(k) = \u03b3(k)x\u0302(k) + \u03b2(k), followed by the other processing done by the original network. These sub-network inputs all have fixed means and variances, and although the joint distribution of these normalized x\u0302(k) can change over the course of training, we expect that the introduction of normalized inputs accelerates the training of the sub-network and, consequently, the network as a whole.\nDuring training we need to backpropagate the gradient of loss ` through this transformation, as well as compute the gradients with respect to the parameters of the BN transform. We use chain rule, as follows:\n\u2202` \u2202x\u0302i = \u2202`\u2202yi \u00b7 \u03b3 \u2202` \u2202\u03c32B = \u2211m i=1 \u2202` \u2202x\u0302i \u00b7 (xi \u2212 \u00b5B) \u00b7 \u221212 (\u03c3 2 B + ) \u22123/2\n\u2202` \u2202\u00b5B = \u2211m i=1 \u2202` \u2202x\u0302i \u00b7 \u22121\u221a\n\u03c32B+\n\u2202` \u2202xi = \u2202`\u2202x\u0302i \u00b7 1\u221a \u03c32B+ + \u2202` \u2202\u03c32B \u00b7 2(xi\u2212\u00b5B)m + \u2202` \u2202\u00b5B \u00b7 1m\n\u2202` \u2202\u03b3 = \u2211m i=1 \u2202` \u2202yi \u00b7 x\u0302i \u2202` \u2202\u03b2 = \u2211m i=1 \u2202` \u2202yi\nThus, BN transform is a differentiable transformation that introduces normalized activations into the network. This ensures that as the model is training, layers can continue learning on input distributions that exhibit less internal covariate shift, thus accelerating the training. Furthermore,\nthe learned affine transform applied to these normalized activations allows the BN transform to represent the identity transformation and preserves the network capacity."

The normalization of activations that depends on the mini-batch allows efficient training, but is neither necessary nor desirable during inference; we want the output to depend only on the input, deterministically.

            "text": "In traditional deep networks, too high a learning rate may result in the gradients that explode or vanish, as well as getting stuck in poor local minima. Batch Normalization helps address these issues. By normalizing activations throughout the network, it prevents small changes in layer parameters from amplifying as the data propagates through a deep network. For example, this enables the sigmoid nonlinearities to more easily stay in their non-saturated regimes, which is crucial for training deep sigmoid networks but has traditionally been hard to accomplish.\nBatch Normalization also makes training more resilient to the parameter scale. Normally, large learning rates may increase the scale of layer parameters, which then amplify the gradient during backpropagation and lead to the model explosion. However, with Batch Normalization, backpropagation through a layer is unaffected by the scale of its parameters. Indeed, for a scalar a,\nBN(Wu) = BN((aW )u)\nand thus \u2202BN((aW )u)\u2202u = \u2202BN(Wu)\n\u2202u , so the scale does not affect the layer Jacobian nor, consequently, the gradient propagation. Moreover, \u2202BN((aW )u)\u2202(aW ) = 1 a \u00b7 \u2202BN(Wu) \u2202W , so larger weights lead to smaller gradients, and Batch Normalization will stabilize the parameter growth.\nWe further conjecture that Batch Normalization may lead the layer Jacobians to have singular values close to 1, which is known to be beneficial for training (Saxe et al., 2013). Consider two consecutive layers with normalized inputs, and the transformation between these normalized vectors: z\u0302 = F (x\u0302). If we assume that x\u0302 and z\u0302 are Gaussian and uncorrelated, and that F (x\u0302) \u2248 J x\u0302 is a linear transformation for the given model parameters, then both x\u0302 and z\u0302 have unit covariances, and I = Cov[\u0302z] = JCov[x\u0302]JT = JJT . Thus, J is orthogonal, which preserves the gradient magnitudes during backpropagation. Although the above assumptions are not true in reality, we expect Batch Normalization to help make gradient propagation better behaved. This remains an area of further study."

We have found that removing Dropout from BN-Inception allows the network to achieve higher validation accuracy. We conjecture that Batch Normalization provides similar regularization benefits as Dropout, since the activations observed for a training example are affected by the random selection of examples in the same mini-batch.\nShuffle training examples more thoroughly. We enabled within-shard shuffling of the training data, which prevents the same examples from always appearing in a mini-batch together.

            "text": "We have presented a novel mechanism for dramatically accelerating the training of deep networks. It is based on the premise that covariate shift, which is known to complicate the training of machine learning systems, also applies to sub-networks and layers, and removing it from internal activations of the network may aid in training. Our proposed method draws its power from normalizing activations, and from incorporating this normalization in the network architecture itself. This ensures that the normalization is appropriately handled by any optimization method that is being used to train the network. To enable stochastic optimization methods commonly used in deep network training, we perform the normalization for each mini-batch, and backpropagate the gradients through the normalization parameters. Batch Normalization adds only two extra parameters per activation, and in doing so preserves the representation ability of the network. We presented an algorithm for constructing, training, and performing inference with batch-normalized networks. The resulting networks can be trained with saturating nonlinearities, are more tolerant to increased training rates, and often do not require Dropout for regularization.\nMerely adding Batch Normalization to a state-of-the-art image classification model yields a substantial speedup in training. By further increasing the learning rates, removing Dropout, and applying other modifications afforded by Batch Normalization, we reach the previous state of the art with only a small fraction of training steps \u2013 and then beat the state of the art in single-network image classification. Furthermore, by combining multiple models trained with Batch Normalization, we perform better than the best known system on ImageNet, by a significant margin.\nOur method bears similarity to the standardization layer of (Gu\u0308lc\u0327ehre & Bengio, 2013), though the two address different goals. Batch Normalization seeks a stable distribution of activation values throughout training, and normal-\nizes the inputs of a nonlinearity since that is where matching the moments is more likely to stabilize the distribution. On the contrary, the standardization layer is applied to the output of the nonlinearity, which results in sparser activations. We have not observed the nonlinearity inputs to be sparse, neither with nor without Batch Normalization. Other notable differences of Batch Normalization include the learned scale and shift that allow the BN transform to represent identity, handling of convolutional layers, and deterministic inference that does not depend on the minibatch.\nIn this work, we have not explored the full range of possibilities that Batch Normalization potentially enables. Our future work includes applications of our method to Recurrent Neural Networks (Pascanu et al., 2013), where the internal covariate shift and the vanishing or exploding gradients may be especially severe, and which would allow us to more thoroughly test the hypothesis that normalization improves gradient propagation (Sec. 3.3). More study is needed of the regularization properties of Batch Normalization, which we believe to be responsible for the improvements we have observed when Dropout is removed from BN-Inception. We plan to investigate whether Batch Normalization can help with domain adaptation, in its traditional sense \u2013 i.e. whether the normalization performed by the network would allow it to more easily generalize to new data distributions, perhaps with just a recomputation of the population means and variances (Alg. 2). Finally, we believe that further theoretical analysis of the algorithm would allow still more improvements and applications."
