Specifically, we focus on the problem of exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning. Drawing inspiration from the intrinsic motivation literature, we use density models to measure uncertainty, and propose a novel algorithm for deriving a pseudo-count from an arbitrary density model. This technique enables us to generalize count-based exploration algorithms to the non-tabular case. We apply our ideas to Atari 2600 games, providing sensible pseudo-counts from raw pixels. We transform these pseudo-counts into exploration bonuses and obtain significantly improved exploration in a number of hard games, including the infamously difficult MONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE.",

            "text": "Exploration algorithms for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are typically concerned with reducing the agent\u2019s uncertainty over the environment\u2019s reward and transition functions. In a tabular setting, this uncertainty can be quantified using confidence intervals derived from Chernoff bounds, or inferred from a posterior over the environment parameters. In fact, both confidence intervals and posterior shrink as the inverse square root of the state-action visit count N(x, a), making this quantity fundamental to most theoretical results on exploration.\nCount-based exploration methods directly use visit counts to guide an agent\u2019s behaviour towards reducing uncertainty. For example, Model-based Interval Estimation with Exploration Bonuses (MBIE-EB; Strehl and Littman, 2008) solves the augmented Bellman equation\nV (x) = max a\u2208A\n[ R\u0302(x, a) + \u03b3 EP\u0302 [V (x \u2032)] + \u03b2N(x, a)\u22121/2 ] ,\ninvolving the empirical reward R\u0302, the empirical transition function P\u0302 , and an exploration bonus proportional to N(x, a)\u22121/2. This bonus accounts for uncertainties in both transition and reward functions and enables a finite-time bound on the agent\u2019s suboptimality.\nIn spite of their pleasant theoretical guarantees, count-based methods have not played a role in the contemporary successes of reinforcement learning (e.g. Mnih et al., 2015). Instead, most practical methods still rely on simple rules such as -greedy. The issue is that visit counts are not directly useful in large domains, where states are rarely visited more than once.\nAnswering a different scientific question, intrinsic motivation aims to provide qualitative guidance for exploration (Schmidhuber, 1991; Oudeyer et al., 2007; Barto, 2013). This guidance can be summarized as \u201cexplore what surprises you\u201d. A typical approach guides the agent based on change\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 86\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n7 N\nov 2\nin prediction error, or learning progress. If en(A) is the error made by the agent at time n over some event A, and en+1(A) the same error after observing a new piece of information, then learning progress is\nen(A)\u2212 en+1(A).\nIntrinsic motivation methods are attractive as they remain applicable in the absence of the Markov property or the lack of a tabular representation, both of which are required by count-based algorithms. Yet the theoretical foundations of intrinsic motivation remain largely absent from the literature, which may explain its slow rate of adoption as a standard approach to exploration.\nIn this paper we provide formal evidence that intrinsic motivation and count-based exploration are but two sides of the same coin. Specifically, we consider a frequently used measure of learning progress, information gain (Cover and Thomas, 1991). Defined as the Kullback-Leibler divergence of a prior distribution from its posterior, information gain can be related to the confidence intervals used in count-based exploration. Our contribution is to propose a new quantity, the pseudo-count, which connects information-gain-as-learning-progress and count-based exploration.\nWe derive our pseudo-count from a density model over the state space. This is in departure from more traditional approaches to intrinsic motivation that consider learning progress with respect to a transition model. We expose the relationship between pseudo-counts, a variant of Schmidhuber\u2019s compression progress we call prediction gain, and information gain. Combined to Kolter and Ng\u2019s negative result on the frequentist suboptimality of Bayesian bonuses, our result highlights the theoretical advantages of pseudo-counts compared to many existing intrinsic motivation methods.\nThe pseudo-counts we introduce here are best thought of as \u201cfunction approximation for exploration\u201d. We bring them to bear on Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013), focusing on games where myopic exploration fails. We extract our pseudo-counts from a simple density model and use them within a variant of MBIE-EB. We apply them to an experience replay setting and to an actor-critic setting, and find improved performance in both cases. Our approach produces dramatic progress on the reputedly most difficult Atari 2600 game, MONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE: within a fraction of the training time, our agent explores a significant portion of the first level and obtains significantly higher scores than previously published agents."

The above notation extends to state-action spaces, and we write Nn(x, a) to explicitly refer to the number of occurrences of a state-action pair when the argument requires it. When x1:n is generated by an ergodic Markov chain, for example if we follow a fixed policy in a finite-state MDP, then the limit point of \u00b5n is the chain\u2019s stationary distribution.\nIn our setting, a density model is any model that assumes states are independently (but not necessarily identically) distributed; a density model is thus a particular kind of generative model. We emphasize that a density model differs from a forward model, which takes into account the temporal relationship between successive states. Note that \u00b5n is itself a density model."

We begin by introducing the recoding probability of a state x:\n\u03c1\u2032n(x) := \u03c1(x ; x1:nx).\nThis is the probability assigned to x by our density model after observing a new occurrence of x. The term \u201crecoding\u201d is inspired from the statistical compression literature, where coding costs are inversely related to probabilities (Cover and Thomas, 1991). When \u03c1 admits a conditional probability distribution, \u03c1\u2032n(x) = Pr\u03c1(Xn+2 = x |X1 . . . Xn = x1:n, Xn+1 = x). We now postulate two unknowns: a pseudo-count function N\u0302n(x), and a pseudo-count total n\u0302. We relate these two unknowns through two constraints:\n\u03c1n(x) = N\u0302n(x)\nn\u0302 \u03c1\u2032n(x) =\nN\u0302n(x) + 1\nn\u0302+ 1 . (1)\nIn words: we require that, after observing one instance of x, the density model\u2019s increase in prediction of that same x should correspond to a unit increase in pseudo-count. The pseudo-count itself is derived from solving the linear system (1):\nN\u0302n(x) = \u03c1n(x)(1\u2212 \u03c1\u2032n(x)) \u03c1\u2032n(x)\u2212 \u03c1n(x) = n\u0302\u03c1n(x). (2)\nNote that the equations (1) yield N\u0302n(x) = 0 (with n\u0302 = \u221e) when \u03c1n(x) = \u03c1\u2032n(x) = 0, and are inconsistent when \u03c1n(x) < \u03c1\u2032n(x) = 1. These cases may arise from poorly behaved density models, but are easily accounted for. From here onwards we will assume a consistent system of equations. Definition 1 (Learning-positive density model). A density model \u03c1 is learning-positive if for all x1:n \u2208 Xn and all x \u2208 X , \u03c1\u2032n(x) \u2265 \u03c1n(x).\nBy inspecting (2), we see that\n1. N\u0302n(x) \u2265 0 if and only if \u03c1 is learning-positive; 2. N\u0302n(x) = 0 if and only if \u03c1n(x) = 0; and\n3. N\u0302n(x) =\u221e if and only if \u03c1n(x) = \u03c1\u2032n(x).\nIn many cases of interest, the pseudo-count N\u0302n(x) matches our intuition. If \u03c1n = \u00b5n then N\u0302n = Nn. Similarly, if \u03c1n is a Dirichlet estimator then N\u0302n recovers the usual notion of pseudo-count. More importantly, if the model generalizes across states then so do pseudo-counts."

            "text": "As an illustrative example, we employ our method to estimate the number of occurrences of an infrequent event in the Atari 2600 video game FREEWAY (Figure 1, screenshot). We use the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013). We will demonstrate the following:\n1. Pseudo-counts are roughly zero for novel events,\n2. they exhibit credible magnitudes,\n3. they respect the ordering of state frequency,\n4. they grow linearly (on average) with real counts,\n5. they are robust in the presence of nonstationary data.\nThese properties suggest that pseudo-counts provide an appropriate generalized notion of visit counts in non-tabular settings.\nIn FREEWAY, the agent must navigate a chicken across a busy road. As our example, we consider estimating the number of times the chicken has reached the very top of the screen. As is the case for many Atari 2600 games, this naturally salient event is associated with an increase in score, which ALE translates into a positive reward. We may reasonably imagine that knowing how certain we are about this part of the environment is useful. After crossing, the chicken is teleported back to the bottom of the screen.\nTo highlight the robustness of our pseudo-count, we consider a nonstationary policy which waits for 250,000 frames, then applies the UP action for 250,000 frames, then waits, then goes UP again. The salient event only occurs during UP periods. It also occurs with the cars in different positions, thus requiring generalization. As a point of reference, we record the pseudo-counts for both the salient event and visits to the chicken\u2019s start position.\nWe use a simplified, pixel-level version of the CTS model for Atari 2600 frames proposed by Bellemare et al. (2014), ignoring temporal dependencies. While the CTS model is rather impoverished in comparison to state-of-the-art density models for images (e.g. Van den Oord et al., 2016), its countbased nature results in extremely fast learning, making it an appealing candidate for exploration. Further details on the model may be found in the appendix.\nExamining the pseudo-counts depicted in Figure 1 confirms that they exhibit the desirable properties listed above. In particular, the pseudo-count is almost zero on the first occurrence of the salient event; it increases slightly during the 3rd period, since the salient and reference events share some common structure; throughout, it remains smaller than the reference pseudo-count. The linearity on average and robustness to nonstationarity are immediate from the graph. Note, however, that the pseudocounts are a fraction of the real visit counts (inasmuch as we can define \u201creal\u201d): by the end of the trial, the start position has been visited about 140,000 times, and the topmost part of the screen, 1285 times. Furthermore, the ratio of recorded pseudo-counts differs from the ratio of real counts. Both effects are quantifiable, as we shall show in Section 5."

            "text": "Having argued that pseudo-counts appropriately generalize visit counts, we will now show that they are closely related to information gain, which is commonly used to quantify novelty or curiosity and consequently as an intrinsic reward. Information gain is defined in relation to a mixture model \u03be over\na class of density modelsM. This model predicts according to a weighted combination fromM:\n\u03ben(x) := \u03be(x ; x1:n) := \u222b \u03c1\u2208M wn(\u03c1)\u03c1(x ; x1:n)d\u03c1,\nwith wn(\u03c1) the posterior weight of \u03c1. This posterior is defined recursively, starting from a prior distribution w0 overM:\nwn+1(\u03c1) := wn(\u03c1, xn+1) wn(\u03c1, x) := wn(\u03c1)\u03c1(x ; x1:n)\n\u03ben(x) . (3)\nInformation gain is then the Kullback-Leibler divergence from prior to posterior that results from observing x: IGn(x) := IG(x ; x1:n) := KL ( wn(\u00b7, x) \u2016wn ) .\nComputing the information gain of a complex density model is often impractical, if not downright intractable. However, a quantity which we call the prediction gain provides us with a good approximation of the information gain. We define the prediction gain of a density model \u03c1 (and in particular, \u03be) as the difference between the recoding log-probability and log-probability of x:\nPGn(x) := log \u03c1\u2032n(x)\u2212 log \u03c1n(x). Prediction gain is nonnegative if and only if \u03c1 is learning-positive. It is related to the pseudo-count:\nN\u0302n(x) \u2248 ( ePGn(x) \u2212 1 )\u22121 ,\nwith equality when \u03c1\u2032n(x)\u2192 0. As the following theorem shows, prediction gain allows us to relate pseudo-count and information gain. Theorem 1. Consider a sequence x1:n \u2208 Xn. Let \u03be be a mixture model over a class of learningpositive modelsM. Let N\u0302n be the pseudo-count derived from \u03be (Equation 2). For this model,\nIGn(x) \u2264 PGn(x) \u2264 N\u0302n(x)\u22121 and PGn(x) \u2264 N\u0302n(x)\u22121/2.\nTheorem 1 suggests that using an exploration bonus proportional to N\u0302n(x)\u22121/2, similar to the MBIE-EB bonus, leads to a behaviour at least as exploratory as one derived from an information gain bonus. Since pseudo-counts correspond to empirical counts in the tabular setting, this approach also preserves known theoretical guarantees. In fact, we are confident pseudo-counts may be used to prove similar results in non-tabular settings.\nOn the other hand, it may be difficult to provide theoretical guarantees about existing bonus-based intrinsic motivation approaches. Kolter and Ng (2009) showed that no algorithm based on a bonus upper bounded by \u03b2Nn(x)\u22121 for any \u03b2 > 0 can guarantee PAC-MDP optimality. Again considering the tabular setting and combining their result to Theorem 1, we conclude that bonuses proportional to immediate information (or prediction) gain are insufficient for theoretically near-optimal exploration: to paraphrase Kolter and Ng, these methods produce explore too little in comparison to pseudo-count bonuses. By inspecting (2) we come to a similar negative conclusion for bonuses proportional to the L1 or L2 distance between \u03be\u2032n and \u03ben.\nUnlike many intrinsic motivation algorithms, pseudo-counts also do not rely on learning a forward (transition and/or reward) model. This point is especially important because a number of powerful density models for images exist (Van den Oord et al., 2016), and because optimality guarantees cannot in general exist for intrinsic motivation algorithms based on forward models."

We use this analysis to assert the consistency of pseudo-counts derived from tabular density models, i.e. models which maintain per-state visit counts. In the appendix we use the same result to bound the approximation error of pseudo-counts derived from directed graphical models, of which our CTS model is a special case. Consider a fixed, infinite sequence x1, x2, . . . fromX . We define the limit of a sequence of functions( f(x ; x1:n) : n \u2208 N ) with respect to the length n of the subsequence x1:n. We additionally assume that the empirical distribution \u00b5n converges pointwise to a distribution \u00b5, and write \u00b5\u2032n(x) for the recoding probability of x under \u00b5n. We begin with two assumptions on our density model.\nAssumption 1. The limits\n(a) r(x) := lim n\u2192\u221e\n\u03c1n(x) \u00b5n(x) (b) r\u0307(x) := lim n\u2192\u221e \u03c1\u2032n(x)\u2212 \u03c1n(x) \u00b5\u2032n(x)\u2212 \u00b5n(x)\nexist for all x; furthermore, r\u0307(x) > 0.\nAssumption (a) states that \u03c1 should eventually assign a probability to x proportional to the limiting empirical distribution \u00b5(x). In particular there must be a state x for which r(x) < 1, unless \u03c1n \u2192 \u00b5. Assumption (b), on the other hand, imposes a restriction on the learning rate of \u03c1 relative to \u00b5\u2019s. As both r(x) and \u00b5(x) exist, Assumption 1 also implies that \u03c1n(x) and \u03c1\u2032n(x) have a common limit.\nTheorem 2. Under Assumption 1, the limit of the ratio of pseudo-counts N\u0302n(x) to empirical counts Nn(x) exists for all x. This limit is\nlim n\u2192\u221e\nN\u0302n(x) Nn(x) = r(x) r\u0307(x)\n( 1\u2212 \u00b5(x)r(x)\n1\u2212 \u00b5(x)\n) .\nThe model\u2019s relative rate of change, whose convergence to r\u0307(x) we require, plays an essential role in the ratio of pseudo- to empirical counts. To see this, consider a sequence (xn : n \u2208 N) generated i.i.d. from a distribution \u00b5 over a finite state space, and a density model defined from a sequence of nonincreasing step-sizes (\u03b1n : n \u2208 N):\n\u03c1n(x) = (1\u2212 \u03b1n)\u03c1n\u22121(x) + \u03b1nI {xn = x} , with initial condition \u03c10(x) = |X |\u22121. For \u03b1n = n\u22121, this density model is the empirical distribution. For \u03b1n = n\u22122/3, we may appeal to well-known results from stochastic approximation (e.g. Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996) and find that almost surely\nlim n\u2192\u221e \u03c1n(x) = \u00b5(x) but lim n\u2192\u221e \u03c1\u2032n(x)\u2212 \u03c1n(x) \u00b5\u2032n(x)\u2212 \u00b5n(x) =\u221e.\nSince \u00b5\u2032n(x) \u2212 \u00b5n(x) = n\u22121(1 \u2212 \u00b5\u2032n(x)), we may think of Assumption 1(b) as also requiring \u03c1 to converge at a rate of \u0398(1/n) for a comparison with the empirical count Nn to be meaningful.

Due to its sparse reward function, most published agents achieve an average score close to zero and completely fail to explore most of the 24 rooms that constitute the first level (Figure 3, top). By contrast, within 50 million frames our agent learns a policy which consistently navigates through 15 rooms (Figure 3, bottom). Our agent also achieves a score higher than anything previously reported, with one run consistently achieving 6600 points by 100 million frames (half the training samples used by Mnih et al. (2015)).

This very separation, however, often leads to deficient exploration: to produce any sensible results, the A3C policy must be regularized with an entropy cost. We trained A3C on 60 Atari 2600 games, with and without the exploration bonus (4). We refer to our augmented algorithm as A3C+. Full details and additional results may be found in the appendix.\nWe found that A3C fails to learn in 15 games, in the sense that the agent does not achieve a score 50% better than random. In comparison, there are only 10 games for which A3C+ fails to improve on the random agent; of these, 8 are games where DQN fails in the same sense.

The functions f(x) := ex\u22121\u2212x and g(x) := ex\u22121\u2212x2 are nonnegative on x \u2208 [0,\u221e).\nProof. The statement regarding f(x) follows directly from the Taylor expansion for ex. Now, the first derivative of g(x) is ex \u2212 2x. It is clearly positive for x \u2265 1. For x \u2208 [0, 1],\nex \u2212 2x = \u221e\u2211 i=0 xi i! \u2212 2x \u2265 1\u2212 x \u2265 0.\nSince g(0) = 0, the second result follows.\nProof (Theorem 1). The inequality IGn(x) \u2264 PGn(x) follows directly from Lemma 1, the nonnegativity of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the fact that all models inM are learning-positive. For the inequality PGn(x) \u2264 N\u0302n(x)\u22121, we write\nN\u0302n(x) \u22121 = (1\u2212 \u03be\u2032n(x))\u22121 \u03be\u2032n(x)\u2212 \u03ben(x) \u03ben(x)\n= (1\u2212 \u03be\u2032n(x))\u22121 ( \u03be\u2032n(x) \u03ben(x) \u2212 1 )\n(a) = (1\u2212 \u03be\u2032n(x))\u22121 ( ePGn(x) \u2212 1 ) (b) \u2265 ePGn(x) \u2212 1 (c)\n\u2265 PGn(x), where (a) follows by definition of prediction gain, (b) from \u03be\u2032n(x) \u2208 [0, 1), and (c) from Lemma 2. Using the second part of Lemma 2 in (c) yields the inequality N\u0302n(x)\u22121/2 \u2265 PGn(x)."

This factored structure allows us to construct approximate density models over X , for example by modelling the joint density as a product of marginals. We write the ith factor of a state x \u2208 X as xi, and write the sequence of the ith factor across x1:n as xi1:n. We will show that directed graphical models (Wainwright and Jordan, 2008) satisfy Assumption 1. A directed graphical model describes a probability distribution over a factored state space. To the ith factor xi is associated a parent set \u03c0(i) \u2286 {1, . . . , i\u2212 1}. Let x\u03c0(i) denote the value of the factors in the parent set. The ith factor model is \u03c1in(x i ; x\u03c0(i)) := \u03c1i(xi ; x1:n, x \u03c0(i)), with the understanding that \u03c1i is allowed to make a different prediction for each value of x\u03c0(i). The state x is assigned the joint probability\n\u03c1GM(x ; x1:n) := k\u220f i=1 \u03c1in(x i ; x\u03c0(i)).\nCommon choices for \u03c1in include the conditional empirical distribution and the Dirichlet estimator.\nProposition 1. Suppose that each factor model \u03c1in converges to the conditional probability distribution \u00b5(xi |x\u03c0(i)) and that for each xi with \u00b5(xi |x\u03c0(i)),\nlim n\u2192\u221e\n\u03c1i(xi ; x1:nx, x \u03c0(i))\u2212 \u03c1i(xi ; x1:n, x\u03c0(i))\n\u00b5(xi ; x1:nx, x\u03c0(i))\u2212 \u00b5(xi ; x1:n, x\u03c0(i)) = 1.\nThen for all x with \u00b5(x) > 0, the density model \u03c1GM satisfies Assumption 1 with\nr(x) =\n\u220fk i=1 \u00b5(x\ni |x\u03c0(i)) \u00b5(x)\nand r\u0307(x) =\n\u2211k i=1 ( 1\u2212 \u00b5(xi |x\u03c0(i)) )\u220f j 6=i \u00b5(x\nj |x\u03c0(j)) 1\u2212 \u00b5(x) .\nThe CTS density model used in our experiments is in fact a particular kind of induced graphical model. The result above thus describes how the pseudo-counts computed in Section 3.2 are asymptotically related to the empirical counts.\nProof. By hypothesis, \u03c1in \u2192 \u00b5(xi |x\u03c0(i)).

            "text": "C.1 CTS Density Model\nOur state space X is the set of all preprocessed Atari 2600 frames.2 Each raw frame is composed of 210\u00d7160 7-bit NTSC pixels (Bellemare et al., 2013). We preprocess these frames by first converting them to grayscale (luminance), then downsampling to 42\u00d742 by averaging over pixel values (Figure 5).\nAside from this preprocessing, our model is very similar to the model used by Bellemare et al. (2014) and Veness et al. (2015). The CTS density model treats x \u2208 X as a factored state, where each (i, j) pixel corresponds to a factor xi,j . The parents of this factor are its upper-left neighbours, i.e. pixels (i \u2212 1, j), (i, j \u2212 1), (i \u2212 1, j \u2212 1) and (i + 1, j \u2212 1) (in this order). The probability of x is then the product of the probability assigned to its factors. Each factor is modelled using a location-dependent CTS model, which predicts the pixel\u2019s colour value conditional on some, all, or possibly none, of the pixel\u2019s parents (Figure 6).\n2Technically, the ALE is partially observable and a frame is an observation, not a state. In many games, however, the current frame is sufficiently informative to guide exploration.\nOriginal Frame (160x210) Downsampled,\n3-bit Greyscale (42x42)\nFigure 5: Sample preprocessed image provided to the CTS model (right), along with the original frame (left). Although details are lost, objects can still be made out.\nxi,j\nFigure 6: Depiction of the CTS \u201cfilter\u201d. Each downsampled pixel is predicted by a location-specific model which can condition on the pixel\u2019s immediate neighbours (in blue).\nC.2 A Taxonomy of Exploration\nWe provide in Table 1 a rough taxonomy of the Atari 2600 games available through the ALE in terms of the difficulty of exploration.\nWe first divided the games into two groups: those for which local exploration (e.g. -greedy) is sufficient to achieve a high scoring policy (easy), and those for which it is not (hard). For example, SPACE INVADERS versus PITFALL!. We further divided the easy group based on whether an -greedy scheme finds a score exploit, that is maximizes the score without achieving the game\u2019s stated objective. For example, KUNG-FU MASTER versus BOXING. While this distinction is not directly used here, score exploits lead to behaviours which are optimal from an ALE perspective but uninteresting to humans. We divide the games in the hard category into dense reward games (MS. PAC-MAN) and sparse reward games (MONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE).\nC.3 Exploration in MONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE\nMONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE is divided into three levels, each composed of 24 rooms arranged in a pyramidal shape (Figure 7). As discussed above, each room poses a number of challenges: to escape the very first room, the agent must climb ladders, dodge a creature, pick up a key, then backtrack to open one of two doors. The number of rooms reached by an agent is therefore a good measure of its ability. By accessing the game RAM, we recorded the location of the agent at each step during the course of training.3 We computed the visit count to each room, averaged over epochs each lasting one million frames. From this information we constructed a map of the agent\u2019s \u201cknown world\u201d, that is, all rooms visited at least once. The agent\u2019s current room number ranges from 0 to 23 (Figure 7) and is stored at RAM location 0x83. Figure 8 shows the set of rooms explored by our DQN agents at different points during training.\nFigure 8 paints a clear picture: after 50 million frames, the agent using exploration bonuses has seen a total of 15 rooms, while the no-bonus agent has seen two. At that point in time, our agent achieves an average score of 2461; by 100 million frames, this figure stands at 3439, higher than anything previously reported. We believe the success of our method in this game is a strong indicator of the usefulness of pseudo-counts for exploration.\nWe remark that without mixing in the Monte-Carlo return, our bonus-based agent still explores significantly more than the no-bonus agent. However, the deep network seems unable to maintain a sufficiently good approximation to the value function, and performance quickly deteriorates. Comparable results using the A3C method provide another example of the practical importance of eligibility traces and return-based methods in reinforcement learning.\nC.4 Improving Exploration for Actor-Critic Methods\nOur implementation of A3C was along the lines mentioned in Mnih et al. (2016) and uses 16 threads. Each thread corresponds to an actor learner and maintains a copy of the density model. All the threads are synchronized with the master thread at regular intervals of 250,000 steps. We followed the same training procedure as that reported in the A3C paper with the following additional steps: We update our density model with the states generated by following the policy. During the policy gradient step, we compute the intrinsic rewards by querying the density model and add it to the extrinsic rewards before clipping them in the range [\u22121, 1] as was done in the A3C paper. This resulted in minimal overhead in computation costs and the memory footprint was manageable (< 32 GB) for most of the Atari games. Our training times were almost the same as the ones reported in the A3C paper. We picked \u03b2 = 0.01 after performing a short parameter sweep over the training games. The choice of training games is the same as mentioned in the A3C paper.\nThe games on which DQN achieves a score of 150% or less of the random score are: ASTEROIDS, DOUBLE DUNK, GRAVITAR, ICE HOCKEY, MONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE, PITFALL!, SKIING, SURROUND, TENNIS, TIME PILOT.\nThe games on which A3C achieves a score of 150% or less of the random score are: BATTLE ZONE, BOWLING, ENDURO, FREEWAY, GRAVITAR, KANGAROO, PITFALL!, ROBOTANK, SKIING, SOLARIS, SURROUND, TENNIS, TIME PILOT, VENTURE.\n3We emphasize that the game RAM is not made available to the agent, and is solely used here in our behavioural analysis.\nThe games on which A3C+ achieves a score of 150% or less of the random score are: DOUBLE DUNK, GRAVITAR, ICE HOCKEY, PITFALL!, SKIING, SOLARIS, SURROUND, TENNIS, TIME PILOT, VENTURE.\nOur experiments involved the stochastic version of the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) without a terminal signal for life loss, which is now the default ALE setting. Briefly, the stochasticity is achieved by accepting the agent action at each frame with probability 1\u2212 p and using the agents previous action during rejection. We used the ALE\u2019s default value of p = 0.25 as has been previously used in Bellemare et al. (2016). For comparison, Table 2 also reports the deterministic + life loss setting also used in the literature.\nAnecdotally, we found that using the life loss signal, while helpful in achieving high scores in some games, is detrimental in MONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE. Recall that the life loss signal was used by Mnih et al. (2015) to treat each of the agent\u2019 lives as a separate episode. For comparison, after 200 million frames A3C+ achieves the following average scores: 1) Stochastic + Life Loss: 142.50; 2) Deterministic + Life Loss: 273.70 3) Stochastic without Life Loss: 1127.05 4) Deterministic without Life Loss: 273.70. The maximum score achieved by 3) is 3600, in comparison to the maximum of 500 achieved by 1) and 3). This large discrepancy is not unsurprising when one considers that losing a life in MONTEZUMA\u2019S REVENGE, and in fact in most games, is very different from restarting a new episode.\nC.5 Comparing Exploration Bonuses\nIn this section we compare the effect of using different exploration bonuses derived from our density model. We consider the following variants:\n\u2022 no exploration bonus, \u2022 N\u0302n(x)\u22121/2, as per MBIE-EB (Strehl and Littman, 2008); \u2022 N\u0302n(x)\u22121, as per BEB (Kolter and Ng, 2009); and \u2022 PGn(x), related to compression progress (Schmidhuber, 2008).\nThe exact form of these bonuses is analogous to (4). We compare these variants after 10, 50, 100, and 200 million frames of training, again in the A3C setup. To compare scores across 60 games, we use\ninter-algorithm score distributions (Bellemare et al., 2013). Inter-algorithm scores are normalized so that 0 corresponds to the worst score on a game, and 1, to the best. If g \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} is a game and zg,a the inter-algorithm score on g for algorithm a, then the score distribution function is\nf(x) := |{g : zg,a \u2265 x}|\nm .\nThe score distribution effectively depicts a kind of cumulative distribution, with a higher overall curve implying better scores across the gamut of Atari 2600 games. A higher curve at x = 1 implies top performance on more games; a higher curve at x = 0 indicates the algorithm does not perform poorly on many games. The scale parameter \u03b2 was optimized to \u03b2 = 0.01 for each variant separately.\nFigure 10 shows that, while prediction gain initially achieves strong performance, by 50 million frames all three algorithms perform equally well. By 200 million frames, the N\u0302\u22121/2 exploration bonus outperforms both prediction gain and no bonus. The prediction gain achieves a decent, but not top-performing score on all games. This matches our earlier argument that using prediction gain results in too little exploration. We hypothesize that the poor performance of the N\u0302\u22121 bonus stems from too abrupt a decay from a large to small intrinsic reward, although more experiments are needed. As a whole, these results show how using PG offers an advantage over the baseline A3C algorithm, which is furthered by using our count-based exploration bonus."
