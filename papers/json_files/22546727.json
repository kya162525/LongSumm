    "abstractText": "Recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arithmetic, but the origin of these regularities has remained opaque. We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.",

            "text": "Semantic vector space models of language represent each word with a real-valued vector. These vectors can be used as features in a variety of applications, such as information retrieval (Manning et al., 2008), document classification (Sebastiani, 2002), question answering (Tellex et al., 2003), named entity recognition (Turian et al., 2010), and parsing (Socher et al., 2013).\nMost word vector methods rely on the distance or angle between pairs of word vectors as the primary method for evaluating the intrinsic quality of such a set of word representations. Recently, Mikolov et al. (2013c) introduced a new evaluation scheme based on word analogies that probes\nthe finer structure of the word vector space by examining not the scalar distance between word vectors, but rather their various dimensions of difference. For example, the analogy \u201cking is to queen as man is to woman\u201d should be encoded in the vector space by the vector equation king \u2212 queen = man \u2212 woman. This evaluation scheme favors models that produce dimensions of meaning, thereby capturing the multi-clustering idea of distributed representations (Bengio, 2009).\nThe two main model families for learning word vectors are: 1) global matrix factorization methods, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) and 2) local context window methods, such as the skip-gram model of Mikolov et al. (2013c). Currently, both families suffer significant drawbacks. While methods like LSA efficiently leverage statistical information, they do relatively poorly on the word analogy task, indicating a sub-optimal vector space structure. Methods like skip-gram may do better on the analogy task, but they poorly utilize the statistics of the corpus since they train on separate local context windows instead of on global co-occurrence counts.\nIn this work, we analyze the model properties necessary to produce linear directions of meaning and argue that global log-bilinear regression models are appropriate for doing so. We propose a specific weighted least squares model that trains on global word-word co-occurrence counts and thus makes efficient use of statistics. The model produces a word vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its state-of-the-art performance of 75% accuracy on the word analogy dataset. We also demonstrate that our methods outperform other current methods on several word similarity tasks, and also on a common named entity recognition (NER) benchmark.\nWe provide the source code for the model as well as trained word vectors at http://nlp. stanford.edu/projects/glove/."

            "text": "Matrix Factorization Methods. Matrix factorization methods for generating low-dimensional word representations have roots stretching as far back as LSA. These methods utilize low-rank approximations to decompose large matrices that capture statistical information about a corpus. The particular type of information captured by such matrices varies by application. In LSA, the matrices are of \u201cterm-document\u201d type, i.e., the rows correspond to words or terms, and the columns correspond to different documents in the corpus. In contrast, the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996), for example, utilizes matrices of \u201cterm-term\u201d type, i.e., the rows and columns correspond to words and the entries correspond to the number of times a given word occurs in the context of another given word.\nA main problem with HAL and related methods is that the most frequent words contribute a disproportionate amount to the similarity measure: the number of times two words co-occur with the or and, for example, will have a large effect on their similarity despite conveying relatively little about their semantic relatedness. A number of techniques exist that addresses this shortcoming of HAL, such as the COALS method (Rohde et al., 2006), in which the co-occurrence matrix is first transformed by an entropy- or correlation-based normalization. An advantage of this type of transformation is that the raw co-occurrence counts, which for a reasonably sized corpus might span 8 or 9 orders of magnitude, are compressed so as to be distributed more evenly in a smaller interval. A variety of newer models also pursue this approach, including a study (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007) that indicates that positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) is a good transformation. More recently, a square root type transformation in the form of Hellinger PCA (HPCA) (Lebret and Collobert, 2014) has been suggested as an effective way of learning word representations.\nShallow Window-Based Methods. Another approach is to learn word representations that aid in making predictions within local context windows. For example, Bengio et al. (2003) introduced a model that learns word vector representations as part of a simple neural network architecture for language modeling. Collobert and Weston (2008) decoupled the word vector training from the downstream training objectives, which paved\nthe way for Collobert et al. (2011) to use the full context of a word for learning the word representations, rather than just the preceding context as is the case with language models.\nRecently, the importance of the full neural network structure for learning useful word representations has been called into question. The skip-gram and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) models of Mikolov et al. (2013a) propose a simple single-layer architecture based on the inner product between two word vectors. Mnih and Kavukcuoglu (2013) also proposed closely-related vector log-bilinear models, vLBL and ivLBL, and Levy et al. (2014) proposed explicit word embeddings based on a PPMI metric.\nIn the skip-gram and ivLBL models, the objective is to predict a word\u2019s context given the word itself, whereas the objective in the CBOW and vLBL models is to predict a word given its context. Through evaluation on a word analogy task, these models demonstrated the capacity to learn linguistic patterns as linear relationships between the word vectors.\nUnlike the matrix factorization methods, the shallow window-based methods suffer from the disadvantage that they do not operate directly on the co-occurrence statistics of the corpus. Instead, these models scan context windows across the entire corpus, which fails to take advantage of the vast amount of repetition in the data."

            "text": "The statistics of word occurrences in a corpus is the primary source of information available to all unsupervised methods for learning word representations, and although many such methods now exist, the question still remains as to how meaning is generated from these statistics, and how the resulting word vectors might represent that meaning. In this section, we shed some light on this question. We use our insights to construct a new model for word representation which we call GloVe, for Global Vectors, because the global corpus statistics are captured directly by the model.\nFirst we establish some notation. Let the matrix of word-word co-occurrence counts be denoted by X , whose entries Xi j tabulate the number of times word j occurs in the context of word i. Let Xi =\u2211\nk Xik be the number of times any word appears in the context of word i. Finally, let Pi j = P( j |i) = Xi j/Xi be the probability that word j appear in the\ncontext of word i. We begin with a simple example that showcases how certain aspects of meaning can be extracted directly from co-occurrence probabilities. Consider two words i and j that exhibit a particular aspect of interest; for concreteness, suppose we are interested in the concept of thermodynamic phase, for which we might take i = ice and j = steam. The relationship of these words can be examined by studying the ratio of their co-occurrence probabilities with various probe words, k. For words k related to ice but not steam, say k = solid, we expect the ratio Pik/Pjk will be large. Similarly, for words k related to steam but not ice, say k = gas, the ratio should be small. For words k like water or fashion, that are either related to both ice and steam, or to neither, the ratio should be close to one. Table 1 shows these probabilities and their ratios for a large corpus, and the numbers confirm these expectations. Compared to the raw probabilities, the ratio is better able to distinguish relevant words (solid and gas) from irrelevant words (water and fashion) and it is also better able to discriminate between the two relevant words.\nThe above argument suggests that the appropriate starting point for word vector learning should be with ratios of co-occurrence probabilities rather than the probabilities themselves. Noting that the ratio Pik/Pjk depends on three words i, j, and k, the most general model takes the form,\nF (wi ,w j , w\u0303k ) = Pik Pjk , (1)\nwhere w \u2208 Rd are word vectors and w\u0303 \u2208 Rd are separate context word vectors whose role will be discussed in Section 4.2. In this equation, the right-hand side is extracted from the corpus, and F may depend on some as-of-yet unspecified parameters. The number of possibilities for F is vast, but by enforcing a few desiderata we can select a unique choice. First, we would like F to encode\nthe information present the ratio Pik/Pjk in the word vector space. Since vector spaces are inherently linear structures, the most natural way to do this is with vector differences. With this aim, we can restrict our consideration to those functions F that depend only on the difference of the two target words, modifying Eqn. (1) to,\nF (wi \u2212 w j , w\u0303k ) = Pik Pjk . (2)\nNext, we note that the arguments of F in Eqn. (2) are vectors while the right-hand side is a scalar. While F could be taken to be a complicated function parameterized by, e.g., a neural network, doing so would obfuscate the linear structure we are trying to capture. To avoid this issue, we can first take the dot product of the arguments,\nF ( (wi \u2212 w j )T w\u0303k ) =\nPik Pjk , (3)\nwhich prevents F from mixing the vector dimensions in undesirable ways. Next, note that for word-word co-occurrence matrices, the distinction between a word and a context word is arbitrary and that we are free to exchange the two roles. To do so consistently, we must not only exchange w \u2194 w\u0303 but also X \u2194 XT . Our final model should be invariant under this relabeling, but Eqn. (3) is not. However, the symmetry can be restored in two steps. First, we require that F be a homomorphism between the groups (R,+) and (R>0,\u00d7 ), i.e.,\nF ( (wi \u2212 w j )T w\u0303k ) = F (wTi w\u0303k )\nF (wTj w\u0303k ) , (4)\nwhich, by Eqn. (3), is solved by,\nF (wTi w\u0303k ) = Pik = Xik Xi . (5)\nThe solution to Eqn. (4) is F = exp, or,\nwTi w\u0303k = log(Pik ) = log(Xik ) \u2212 log(Xi ) . (6)\nNext, we note that Eqn. (6) would exhibit the exchange symmetry if not for the log(Xi ) on the right-hand side. However, this term is independent of k so it can be absorbed into a bias bi for wi . Finally, adding an additional bias b\u0303k for w\u0303k restores the symmetry,\nwTi w\u0303k + bi + b\u0303k = log(Xik ) . (7)\nEqn. (7) is a drastic simplification over Eqn. (1), but it is actually ill-defined since the logarithm diverges whenever its argument is zero. One resolution to this issue is to include an additive shift in the logarithm, log(Xik ) \u2192 log(1 + Xik ), which maintains the sparsity of X while avoiding the divergences. The idea of factorizing the log of the co-occurrence matrix is closely related to LSA and we will use the resulting model as a baseline in our experiments. A main drawback to this model is that it weighs all co-occurrences equally, even those that happen rarely or never. Such rare cooccurrences are noisy and carry less information than the more frequent ones \u2014 yet even just the zero entries account for 75\u201395% of the data in X , depending on the vocabulary size and corpus.\nWe propose a new weighted least squares regression model that addresses these problems. Casting Eqn. (7) as a least squares problem and introducing a weighting function f (Xi j ) into the cost function gives us the model\nJ = V\u2211\ni, j=1\nf ( Xi j ) ( wTi w\u0303 j + bi + b\u0303j \u2212 log Xi j )2 ,\n(8) where V is the size of the vocabulary. The weighting function should obey the following properties:\n1. f (0) = 0. If f is viewed as a continuous function, it should vanish as x \u2192 0 fast enough that the limx\u21920 f (x) log2 x is finite.\n2. f (x) should be non-decreasing so that rare co-occurrences are not overweighted.\n3. f (x) should be relatively small for large values of x, so that frequent co-occurrences are not overweighted.\nOf course a large number of functions satisfy these properties, but one class of functions that we found to work well can be parameterized as,\nf (x) = {\n(x/xmax)\u03b1 if x < xmax 1 otherwise .\n(9)\nThe performance of the model depends weakly on the cutoff, which we fix to xmax = 100 for all our experiments. We found that \u03b1 = 3/4 gives a modest improvement over a linear version with \u03b1 = 1. Although we offer only empirical motivation for choosing the value 3/4, it is interesting that a similar fractional power scaling was found to give the best performance in (Mikolov et al., 2013a)."

            "text": "Because all unsupervised methods for learning word vectors are ultimately based on the occurrence statistics of a corpus, there should be commonalities between the models. Nevertheless, certain models remain somewhat opaque in this regard, particularly the recent window-based methods like skip-gram and ivLBL. Therefore, in this subsection we show how these models are related to our proposed model, as defined in Eqn. (8).\nThe starting point for the skip-gram or ivLBL methods is a model Qi j for the probability that word j appears in the context of word i. For concreteness, let us assume that Qi j is a softmax,\nQi j = exp(wTi w\u0303 j )\u2211V\nk=1 exp(w T i w\u0303k )\n. (10)\nMost of the details of these models are irrelevant for our purposes, aside from the the fact that they attempt to maximize the log probability as a context window scans over the corpus. Training proceeds in an on-line, stochastic fashion, but the implied global objective function can be written as,\nJ = \u2212 \u2211\ni\u2208corpus j\u2208context(i)\nlog Qi j . (11)\nEvaluating the normalization factor of the softmax for each term in this sum is costly. To allow for efficient training, the skip-gram and ivLBL models introduce approximations to Qi j . However, the sum in Eqn. (11) can be evaluated much\nmore efficiently if we first group together those terms that have the same values for i and j,\nJ = \u2212 V\u2211 i=1 V\u2211 j=1 Xi j log Qi j , (12)\nwhere we have used the fact that the number of like terms is given by the co-occurrence matrix X .\nRecalling our notation for Xi = \u2211\nk Xik and Pi j = Xi j/Xi , we can rewrite J as,\nJ = \u2212 V\u2211 i=1 Xi V\u2211 j=1 Pi j log Qi j = V\u2211 i=1 XiH (Pi ,Qi ) ,\n(13) where H (Pi ,Qi ) is the cross entropy of the distributions Pi and Qi , which we define in analogy to Xi . As a weighted sum of cross-entropy error, this objective bears some formal resemblance to the weighted least squares objective of Eqn. (8). In fact, it is possible to optimize Eqn. (13) directly as opposed to the on-line training methods used in the skip-gram and ivLBL models. One could interpret this objective as a \u201cglobal skip-gram\u201d model, and it might be interesting to investigate further. On the other hand, Eqn. (13) exhibits a number of undesirable properties that ought to be addressed before adopting it as a model for learning word vectors.\nTo begin, cross entropy error is just one among many possible distance measures between probability distributions, and it has the unfortunate property that distributions with long tails are often modeled poorly with too much weight given to the unlikely events. Furthermore, for the measure to be bounded it requires that the model distribution Q be properly normalized. This presents a computational bottleneck owing to the sum over the whole vocabulary in Eqn. (10), and it would be desirable to consider a different distance measure that did not require this property of Q. A natural choice would be a least squares objective in which normalization factors in Q and P are discarded,\nJ\u0302 = \u2211 i, j Xi ( P\u0302i j \u2212 Q\u0302i j )2 (14) where P\u0302i j = Xi j and Q\u0302i j = exp(wTi w\u0303 j ) are the unnormalized distributions. At this stage another problem emerges, namely that Xi j often takes very large values, which can complicate the optimization. An effective remedy is to minimize the\nsquared error of the logarithms of P\u0302 and Q\u0302 instead, J\u0302 = \u2211 i, j Xi ( log P\u0302i j \u2212 log Q\u0302i j )2\n= \u2211 i, j Xi ( wTi w\u0303 j \u2212 log Xi j )2 . (15) Finally, we observe that while the weighting factor Xi is preordained by the on-line training method inherent to the skip-gram and ivLBL models, it is by no means guaranteed to be optimal. In fact, Mikolov et al. (2013a) observe that performance can be increased by filtering the data so as to reduce the effective value of the weighting factor for frequent words. With this in mind, we introduce a more general weighting function, which we are free to take to depend on the context word as well. The result is,\nJ\u0302 = \u2211 i, j f (Xi j ) ( wTi w\u0303 j \u2212 log Xi j )2 , (16) which is equivalent1 to the cost function of Eqn. (8), which we derived previously."

            "text": "As can be seen from Eqn. (8) and the explicit form of the weighting function f (X ), the computational complexity of the model depends on the number of nonzero elements in the matrix X . As this number is always less than the total number of entries of the matrix, the model scales no worse than O( |V |2). At first glance this might seem like a substantial improvement over the shallow windowbased approaches, which scale with the corpus size, |C |. However, typical vocabularies have hundreds of thousands of words, so that |V |2 can be in the hundreds of billions, which is actually much larger than most corpora. For this reason it is important to determine whether a tighter bound can be placed on the number of nonzero elements of X .\nIn order to make any concrete statements about the number of nonzero elements in X , it is necessary to make some assumptions about the distribution of word co-occurrences. In particular, we will assume that the number of co-occurrences of word i with word j, Xi j , can be modeled as a power-law function of the frequency rank of that word pair, ri j :\nXi j = k\n(ri j )\u03b1 . (17)\n1We could also include bias terms in Eqn. (16).\nThe total number of words in the corpus is proportional to the sum over all elements of the cooccurrence matrix X ,\n|C | \u223c \u2211 i j Xi j = |X |\u2211 r=1 k r\u03b1 = kH|X |,\u03b1 , (18)\nwhere we have rewritten the last sum in terms of the generalized harmonic number Hn,m . The upper limit of the sum, |X |, is the maximum frequency rank, which coincides with the number of nonzero elements in the matrix X . This number is also equal to the maximum value of r in Eqn. (17) such that Xi j \u2265 1, i.e., |X | = k1/\u03b1 . Therefore we can write Eqn. (18) as,\n|C | \u223c |X |\u03b1 H|X |,\u03b1 . (19)\nWe are interested in how |X | is related to |C | when both numbers are large; therefore we are free to expand the right hand side of the equation for large |X |. For this purpose we use the expansion of generalized harmonic numbers (Apostol, 1976),\nHx,s = x1\u2212s\n1 \u2212 s + \u03b6 (s) + O(x \u2212s ) if s > 0, s , 1 ,\n(20) giving,\n|C | \u223c |X | 1 \u2212 \u03b1 + \u03b6 (\u03b1) |X | \u03b1 + O(1) , (21)\nwhere \u03b6 (s) is the Riemann zeta function. In the limit that X is large, only one of the two terms on the right hand side of Eqn. (21) will be relevant, and which term that is depends on whether \u03b1 > 1,\n|X | = { O(|C |) if \u03b1 < 1, O(|C |1/\u03b1 ) if \u03b1 > 1. (22)\nFor the corpora studied in this article, we observe that Xi j is well-modeled by Eqn. (17) with \u03b1 = 1.25. In this case we have that |X | = O(|C |0.8). Therefore we conclude that the complexity of the model is much better than the worst case O(V 2), and in fact it does somewhat better than the on-line window-based methods which scale like O(|C |)."

We tokenize and lowercase each corpus with the Stanford tokenizer, build a vocabulary of the 400,000 most frequent words6, and then construct a matrix of cooccurrence counts X . In constructing X , we must choose how large the context window should be and whether to distinguish left context from right context. We explore the effect of these choices below. In all cases we use a decreasing weighting function, so that word pairs that are d words apart contribute 1/d to the total count. This is one way to account for the fact that very distant word pairs are expected to contain less relevant information about the words\u2019 relationship to one another.\nFor all our experiments, we set xmax = 100, \u03b1 = 3/4, and train the model using AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), stochastically sampling nonzero elements from X , with initial learning rate of 0.05. We run 50 iterations for vectors smaller than 300 dimensions, and 100 iterations otherwise (see Section 4.6 for more details about the convergence rate). Unless otherwise noted, we use a context of ten words to the left and ten words to the right.\nThe model generates two sets of word vectors, W and W\u0303 . When X is symmetric, W and W\u0303 are equivalent and differ only as a result of their random initializations; the two sets of vectors should perform equivalently.

With word2vec, we train the skip-gram (SG\u2020) and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW\u2020) models on the 6 billion token corpus (Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5) with a vocabulary of the top 400,000 most frequent words and a context window size of 10. We used 10 negative samples, which we show in Section 4.6 to be a good choice for this corpus.\nFor the SVD baselines, we generate a truncated matrix Xtrunc which retains the information of how frequently each word occurs with only the top 10,000 most frequent words. This step is typical of many matrix-factorization-based methods as the extra columns can contribute a disproportionate number of zero entries and the methods are otherwise computationally expensive.\nThe singular vectors of this matrix constitute the baseline \u201cSVD\u201d. We also evaluate two related baselines: \u201cSVD-S\u201d in which we take the SVD of\u221a\nXtrunc, and \u201cSVD-L\u201d in which we take the SVD of log(1+ Xtrunc).

We construct a model that utilizes this main benefit of count data while simultaneously capturing the meaningful linear substructures prevalent in recent log-bilinear prediction-based methods like word2vec.
