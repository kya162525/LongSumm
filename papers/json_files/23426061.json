    "abstractText": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM\u2019s BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM\u2019s performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.",

            "text": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are extremely powerful machine learning models that achieve excellent performance on difficult problems such as speech recognition [13, 7] and visual object recognition [19, 6, 21, 20]. DNNs are powerful because they can perform arbitrary parallel computation for a modest number of steps. A surprising example of the power of DNNs is their ability to sort N N -bit numbers using only 2 hidden layers of quadratic size [27]. So, while neural networks are related to conventional statistical models, they learn an intricate computation. Furthermore, large DNNs can be trained with supervised backpropagation whenever the labeled training set has enough information to specify the network\u2019s parameters. Thus, if there exists a parameter setting of a large DNN that achieves good results (for example, because humans can solve the task very rapidly), supervised backpropagation will find these parameters and solve the problem.\nDespite their flexibility and power, DNNs can only be applied to problems whose inputs and targets can be sensibly encoded with vectors of fixed dimensionality. It is a significant limitation, since many important problems are best expressed with sequences whose lengths are not known a-priori. For example, speech recognition and machine translation are sequential problems. Likewise, question answering can also be seen as mapping a sequence of words representing the question to a\nsequence of words representing the answer. It is therefore clear that a domain-independent method that learns to map sequences to sequences would be useful.\nSequences pose a challenge for DNNs because they require that the dimensionality of the inputs and outputs is known and fixed. In this paper, we show that a straightforward application of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture [16] can solve general sequence to sequence problems. The idea is to use one LSTM to read the input sequence, one timestep at a time, to obtain large fixeddimensional vector representation, and then to use another LSTM to extract the output sequence from that vector (fig. 1). The second LSTM is essentially a recurrent neural network language model [28, 23, 30] except that it is conditioned on the input sequence. The LSTM\u2019s ability to successfully learn on data with long range temporal dependencies makes it a natural choice for this application due to the considerable time lag between the inputs and their corresponding outputs (fig. 1).\nThere have been a number of related attempts to address the general sequence to sequence learning problem with neural networks. Our approach is closely related to Kalchbrenner and Blunsom [18] who were the first to map the entire input sentence to vector, and is very similar to Cho et al. [5]. Graves [10] introduced a novel differentiable attention mechanism that allows neural networks to focus on different parts of their input, and an elegant variant of this idea was successfully applied to machine translation by Bahdanau et al. [2]. The Connectionist Sequence Classification is another popular technique for mapping sequences to sequences with neural networks, although it assumes a monotonic alignment between the inputs and the outputs [11].\nThe main result of this work is the following. On the WMT\u201914 English to French translation task, we obtained a BLEU score of 34.81 by directly extracting translations from an ensemble of 5 deep LSTMs (with 380M parameters each) using a simple left-to-right beam-search decoder. This is by far the best result achieved by direct translation with large neural networks. For comparison, the BLEU score of a SMT baseline on this dataset is 33.30 [29]. The 34.81 BLEU score was achieved by an LSTM with a vocabulary of 80k words, so the score was penalized whenever the reference translation contained a word not covered by these 80k. This result shows that a relatively unoptimized neural network architecture which has much room for improvement outperforms a mature phrase-based SMT system.\nFinally, we used the LSTM to rescore the publicly available 1000-best lists of the SMT baseline on the same task [29]. By doing so, we obtained a BLEU score of 36.5, which improves the baseline by 3.2 BLEU points and is close to the previous state-of-the-art (which is 37.0 [9]).\nSurprisingly, the LSTM did not suffer on very long sentences, despite the recent experience of other researchers with related architectures [26]. We were able to do well on long sentences because we reversed the order of words in the source sentence but not the target sentences in the training and test set. By doing so, we introduced many short term dependencies that made the optimization problem much simpler (see sec. 2 and 3.3). As a result, SGD could learn LSTMs that had no trouble with long sentences. The simple trick of reversing the words in the source sentence is one of the key technical contributions of this work.\nA useful property of the LSTM is that it learns to map an input sentence of variable length into a fixed-dimensional vector representation. Given that translations tend to be paraphrases of the source sentences, the translation objective encourages the LSTM to find sentence representations that capture their meaning, as sentences with similar meanings are close to each other while different\nsentences meanings will be far. A qualitative evaluation supports this claim, showing that our model is aware of word order and is fairly invariant to the active and passive voice."

            "text": "The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [31, 28] is a natural generalization of feedforward neural networks to sequences. Given a sequence of inputs (x1, . . . , xT ), a standard RNN computes a sequence of outputs (y1, . . . , yT ) by iterating the following equation:\nht = sigm ( W hxxt +W hhht\u22121 )\nyt = W yhht\nThe RNN can easily map sequences to sequences whenever the alignment between the inputs the outputs is known ahead of time. However, it is not clear how to apply an RNN to problems whose input and the output sequences have different lengths with complicated and non-monotonic relationships.\nA simple strategy for general sequence learning is to map the input sequence to a fixed-sized vector using one RNN, and then to map the vector to the target sequence with another RNN (this approach has also been taken by Cho et al. [5]). While it could work in principle since the RNN is provided with all the relevant information, it would be difficult to train the RNNs due to the resulting long term dependencies [14, 4] (figure 1) [16, 15]. However, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [16] is known to learn problems with long range temporal dependencies, so an LSTM may succeed in this setting.\nThe goal of the LSTM is to estimate the conditional probability p(y1, . . . , yT \u2032 |x1, . . . , xT ) where (x1, . . . , xT ) is an input sequence and y1, . . . , yT \u2032 is its corresponding output sequence whose length T \u2032 may differ from T . The LSTM computes this conditional probability by first obtaining the fixeddimensional representation v of the input sequence (x1, . . . , xT ) given by the last hidden state of the LSTM, and then computing the probability of y1, . . . , yT \u2032 with a standard LSTM-LM formulation whose initial hidden state is set to the representation v of x1, . . . , xT :\np(y1, . . . , yT \u2032 |x1, . . . , xT ) = T \u2032 \u220f\nt=1\np(yt|v, y1, . . . , yt\u22121) (1)\nIn this equation, each p(yt|v, y1, . . . , yt\u22121) distribution is represented with a softmax over all the words in the vocabulary. We use the LSTM formulation from Graves [10]. Note that we require that each sentence ends with a special end-of-sentence symbol \u201c<EOS>\u201d, which enables the model to define a distribution over sequences of all possible lengths. The overall scheme is outlined in figure 1, where the shown LSTM computes the representation of \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201c<EOS>\u201d and then uses this representation to compute the probability of \u201cW\u201d, \u201cX\u201d, \u201cY\u201d, \u201cZ\u201d, \u201c<EOS>\u201d.\nOur actual models differ from the above description in three important ways. First, we used two different LSTMs: one for the input sequence and another for the output sequence, because doing so increases the number model parameters at negligible computational cost and makes it natural to train the LSTM on multiple language pairs simultaneously [18]. Second, we found that deep LSTMs significantly outperformed shallow LSTMs, so we chose an LSTM with four layers. Third, we found it extremely valuable to reverse the order of the words of the input sentence. So for example, instead of mapping the sentence a, b, c to the sentence \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, the LSTM is asked to map c, b, a to \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, where \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 is the translation of a, b, c. This way, a is in close proximity to \u03b1, b is fairly close to \u03b2, and so on, a fact that makes it easy for SGD to \u201cestablish communication\u201d between the input and the output. We found this simple data transformation to greatly boost the performance of the LSTM."

We chose this translation task and this specific training set subset because of the public availability of a tokenized training and test set together with 1000-best lists from the baseline SMT [29].\nAs typical neural language models rely on a vector representation for each word, we used a fixed vocabulary for both languages. We used 160,000 of the most frequent words for the source language and 80,000 of the most frequent words for the target language.

Once training is complete, we produce translations by finding the most likely translation according to the LSTM:\nT\u0302 = argmax T p(T |S) (2)\nWe search for the most likely translation using a simple left-to-right beam search decoder which maintains a small number B of partial hypotheses, where a partial hypothesis is a prefix of some translation. At each timestep we extend each partial hypothesis in the beam with every possible word in the vocabulary. This greatly increases the number of the hypotheses so we discard all but the B most likely hypotheses according to the model\u2019s log probability. As soon as the \u201c<EOS>\u201d symbol is appended to a hypothesis, it is removed from the beam and is added to the set of complete hypotheses. While this decoder is approximate, it is simple to implement. Interestingly, our system performs well even with a beam size of 1, and a beam of size 2 provides most of the benefits of beam search (Table 1).\nWe also used the LSTM to rescore the 1000-best lists produced by the baseline system [29]. To rescore an n-best list, we computed the log probability of every hypothesis with our LSTM and took an even average with their score and the LSTM\u2019s score."

            "text": "While the LSTM is capable of solving problems with long term dependencies, we discovered that the LSTM learns much better when the source sentences are reversed (the target sentences are not reversed). By doing so, the LSTM\u2019s test perplexity dropped from 5.8 to 4.7, and the test BLEU scores of its decoded translations increased from 25.9 to 30.6.\nWhile we do not have a complete explanation to this phenomenon, we believe that it is caused by the introduction of many short term dependencies to the dataset. Normally, when we concatenate a source sentence with a target sentence, each word in the source sentence is far from its corresponding word in the target sentence. As a result, the problem has a large \u201cminimal time lag\u201d [17]. By reversing the words in the source sentence, the average distance between corresponding words in the source and target language is unchanged. However, the first few words in the source language are now very close to the first few words in the target language, so the problem\u2019s minimal time lag is greatly reduced. Thus, backpropagation has an easier time \u201cestablishing communication\u201d between the source sentence and the target sentence, which in turn results in substantially improved overall performance.\nInitially, we believed that reversing the input sentences would only lead to more confident predictions in the early parts of the target sentence and to less confident predictions in the later parts. However, LSTMs trained on reversed source sentences did much better on long sentences than LSTMs\ntrained on the raw source sentences (see sec. 3.7), which suggests that reversing the input sentences results in LSTMs with better memory utilization."

To address this problem, we made sure that all sentences within a minibatch were roughly of the same length, which a 2x speedup."

So far, the simplest and most effective way of applying an RNN-Language Model (RNNLM) [23] or a\nFeedforward Neural Network Language Model (NNLM) [3] to an MT task is by rescoring the nbest lists of a strong MT baseline [22], which reliably improves translation quality.\nMore recently, researchers have begun to look into ways of including information about the source language into the NNLM. Examples of this work include Auli et al. [1], who combine an NNLM with a topic model of the input sentence, which improves rescoring performance. Devlin et al. [8] followed a similar approach, but they incorporated their NNLM into the decoder of an MT system and used the decoder\u2019s alignment information to provide the NNLM with the most useful words in the input sentence. Their approach was highly successful and it achieved large improvements over their baseline.\nOur work is closely related to Kalchbrenner and Blunsom [18], who were the first to map the input sentence into a vector and then back to a sentence, although they map sentences to vectors using convolutional neural networks, which lose the ordering of the words. Similarly to this work, Cho et al. [5] used an LSTM-like RNN architecture to map sentences into vectors and back, although their primary focus was on integrating their neural network into an SMT system. Bahdanau et al. [2] also attempted direct translations with a neural network that used an attention mechanism to overcome the poor performance on long sentences experienced by Cho et al. [5] and achieved encouraging results. Likewise, Pouget-Abadie et al. [26] attempted to address the memory problem of Cho et al. [5] by translating pieces of the source sentence in way that produces smooth translations, which is similar to a phrase-based approach. We suspect that they could achieve similar improvements by simply training their networks on reversed source sentences.\nEnd-to-end training is also the focus of Hermann et al. [12], whose model represents the inputs and outputs by feedforward networks, and map them to similar points in space. However, their approach cannot generate translations directly: to get a translation, they need to do a look up for closest vector in the pre-computed database of sentences, or to rescore a sentence."

The success of our simple LSTM-based approach on MT suggests that it should do well on many other sequence learning problems, provided they have enough training data.\nWe were surprised by the extent of the improvement obtained by reversing the words in the source sentences. We conclude that it is important to find a problem encoding that has the greatest number of short term dependencies, as they make the learning problem much simpler. In particular, while we were unable to train a standard RNN on the non-reversed translation problem (shown in fig. 1), we believe that a standard RNN should be easily trainable when the source sentences are reversed (although we did not verify it experimentally).\nWe were also surprised by the ability of the LSTM to correctly translate very long sentences. We were initially convinced that the LSTM would fail on long sentences due to its limited memory, and other researchers reported poor performance on long sentences with a model similar to ours [5, 2, 26]. And yet, LSTMs trained on the reversed dataset had little difficulty translating long sentences.\nMost importantly, we demonstrated that a simple, straightforward and a relatively unoptimized approach can outperform a mature SMT system, so further work will likely lead to even greater translation accuracies. These results suggest that our approach will likely do well on other challenging sequence to sequence problems."
