    "abstractText": "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder\u2013decoders and encode a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder\u2013decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.",

            "text": "Neural machine translation is a newly emerging approach to machine translation, recently proposed by Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013), Sutskever et al. (2014) and Cho et al. (2014b). Unlike the traditional phrase-based translation system (see, e.g., Koehn et al., 2003) which consists of many small sub-components that are tuned separately, neural machine translation attempts to build and train a single, large neural network that reads a sentence and outputs a correct translation.\nMost of the proposed neural machine translation models belong to a family of encoder\u2013 decoders (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014a), with an encoder and a decoder for each language, or involve a language-specific encoder applied to each sentence whose outputs are then compared (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014). An encoder neural network reads and encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector. A decoder then outputs a translation from the encoded vector. The whole encoder\u2013decoder system, which consists of the encoder and the decoder for a language pair, is jointly trained to maximize the probability of a correct translation given a source sentence.\nA potential issue with this encoder\u2013decoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to compress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a fixed-length vector. This may make it difficult for the neural network to cope with long sentences, especially those that are longer than the sentences in the training corpus. Cho et al. (2014b) showed that indeed the performance of a basic encoder\u2013decoder deteriorates rapidly as the length of an input sentence increases.\nIn order to address this issue, we introduce an extension to the encoder\u2013decoder model which learns to align and translate jointly. Each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it (soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is concentrated. The model then predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with these source positions and all the previous generated target words.\n\u2217CIFAR Senior Fellow\nar X\niv :1\n40 9.\n04 73\nv7 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n1 9\nM ay\n2 01\nThe most important distinguishing feature of this approach from the basic encoder\u2013decoder is that it does not attempt to encode a whole input sentence into a single fixed-length vector. Instead, it encodes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively while decoding the translation. This frees a neural translation model from having to squash all the information of a source sentence, regardless of its length, into a fixed-length vector. We show this allows a model to cope better with long sentences.\nIn this paper, we show that the proposed approach of jointly learning to align and translate achieves significantly improved translation performance over the basic encoder\u2013decoder approach. The improvement is more apparent with longer sentences, but can be observed with sentences of any length. On the task of English-to-French translation, the proposed approach achieves, with a single model, a translation performance comparable, or close, to the conventional phrase-based system. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the proposed model finds a linguistically plausible (soft-)alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding target sentence."

            "text": "From a probabilistic perspective, translation is equivalent to finding a target sentence y that maximizes the conditional probability of y given a source sentence x, i.e., argmaxy p(y | x). In neural machine translation, we fit a parameterized model to maximize the conditional probability of sentence pairs using a parallel training corpus. Once the conditional distribution is learned by a translation model, given a source sentence a corresponding translation can be generated by searching for the sentence that maximizes the conditional probability.\nRecently, a number of papers have proposed the use of neural networks to directly learn this conditional distribution (see, e.g., Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014a; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014b; Forcada and N\u0303eco, 1997). This neural machine translation approach typically consists of two components, the first of which encodes a source sentence x and the second decodes to a target sentence y. For instance, two recurrent neural networks (RNN) were used by (Cho et al., 2014a) and (Sutskever et al., 2014) to encode a variable-length source sentence into a fixed-length vector and to decode the vector into a variable-length target sentence.\nDespite being a quite new approach, neural machine translation has already shown promising results. Sutskever et al. (2014) reported that the neural machine translation based on RNNs with long shortterm memory (LSTM) units achieves close to the state-of-the-art performance of the conventional phrase-based machine translation system on an English-to-French translation task.1 Adding neural components to existing translation systems, for instance, to score the phrase pairs in the phrase table (Cho et al., 2014a) or to re-rank candidate translations (Sutskever et al., 2014), has allowed to surpass the previous state-of-the-art performance level."

(2014) upon which we build a novel architecture that learns to align and translate simultaneously.\nIn the Encoder\u2013Decoder framework, an encoder reads the input sentence, a sequence of vectors x = (x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xTx), into a vector c.2 The most common approach is to use an RNN such that ht = f (xt, ht\u22121) (1) and\nc = q ({h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hTx}) , where ht \u2208 Rn is a hidden state at time t, and c is a vector generated from the sequence of the hidden states. f and q are some nonlinear functions. Sutskever et al. (2014) used an LSTM as f and q ({h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hT }) = hT , for instance.\n1 We mean by the state-of-the-art performance, the performance of the conventional phrase-based system without using any neural network-based component.\n2 Although most of the previous works (see, e.g., Cho et al., 2014a; Sutskever et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) used to encode a variable-length input sentence into a fixed-length vector, it is not necessary, and even it may be beneficial to have a variable-length vector, as we will show later.\nThe decoder is often trained to predict the next word yt\u2032 given the context vector c and all the previously predicted words {y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yt\u2032\u22121}. In other words, the decoder defines a probability over the translation y by decomposing the joint probability into the ordered conditionals:\np(y) = T\u220f t=1 p(yt | {y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yt\u22121} , c), (2)\nwhere y = ( y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yTy ) . With an RNN, each conditional probability is modeled as\np(yt | {y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yt\u22121} , c) = g(yt\u22121, st, c), (3)\nwhere g is a nonlinear, potentially multi-layered, function that outputs the probability of yt, and st is the hidden state of the RNN. It should be noted that other architectures such as a hybrid of an RNN and a de-convolutional neural network can be used (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013)."

The new architecture consists of a bidirectional RNN as an encoder (Sec. 3.2) and a decoder that emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation (Sec. 3.1).\n3.1 DECODER: GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nIn a new model architecture, we define each conditional probability in Eq. (2) as:\np(yi|y1, . . . , yi\u22121,x) = g(yi\u22121, si, ci), (4)\nwhere si is an RNN hidden state for time i, computed by\nsi = f(si\u22121, yi\u22121, ci).\nIt should be noted that unlike the existing encoder\u2013decoder approach (see Eq. (2)), here the probability is conditioned on a distinct context vector ci for each target word yi.\nThe context vector ci depends on a sequence of annotations (h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hTx) to which an encoder maps the input sentence. Each annotation hi contains information about the whole input sequence with a strong focus on the parts surrounding the i-th word of the input sequence. We explain in detail how the annotations are computed in the next section.\nThe context vector ci is, then, computed as a weighted sum of these annotations hi:\nci = Tx\u2211 j=1 \u03b1ijhj . (5)\nThe weight \u03b1ij of each annotation hj is computed by\n\u03b1ij = exp (eij)\u2211Tx k=1 exp (eik) , (6)\nwhere eij = a(si\u22121, hj)\nis an alignment model which scores how well the inputs around position j and the output at position i match. The score is based on the RNN hidden state si\u22121 (just before emitting yi, Eq. (4)) and the j-th annotation hj of the input sentence.\nWe parametrize the alignment model a as a feedforward neural network which is jointly trained with all the other components of the proposed system. Note that unlike in traditional machine translation,\nthe alignment is not considered to be a latent variable. Instead, the alignment model directly computes a soft alignment, which allows the gradient of the cost function to be backpropagated through. This gradient can be used to train the alignment model as well as the whole translation model jointly.\nWe can understand the approach of taking a weighted sum of all the annotations as computing an expected annotation, where the expectation is over possible alignments. Let \u03b1ij be a probability that the target word yi is aligned to, or translated from, a source word xj . Then, the i-th context vector ci is the expected annotation over all the annotations with probabilities \u03b1ij .\nThe probability \u03b1ij , or its associated energy eij , reflects the importance of the annotation hj with respect to the previous hidden state si\u22121 in deciding the next state si and generating yi. Intuitively, this implements a mechanism of attention in the decoder. The decoder decides parts of the source sentence to pay attention to. By letting the decoder have an attention mechanism, we relieve the encoder from the burden of having to encode all information in the source sentence into a fixedlength vector. With this new approach the information can be spread throughout the sequence of annotations, which can be selectively retrieved by the decoder accordingly."

However, in the proposed scheme, we would like the annotation of each word to summarize not only the preceding words, but also the following words. Hence, we propose to use a bidirectional RNN (BiRNN, Schuster and Paliwal, 1997), which has been successfully used recently in speech recognition (see, e.g., Graves et al., 2013).\nA BiRNN consists of forward and backward RNN\u2019s. The forward RNN \u2212\u2192 f reads the input sequence as it is ordered (from x1 to xTx ) and calculates a sequence of forward hidden states ( \u2212\u2192 h 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2212\u2192 h Tx). The backward RNN \u2190\u2212 f reads the sequence in the reverse order (from xTx to x1), resulting in a sequence of backward hidden states ( \u2190\u2212 h 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2190\u2212 h Tx). We obtain an annotation for each word xj by concatenating the forward hidden state \u2212\u2192 h j and the backward one \u2190\u2212 h j , i.e., hj = [\u2212\u2192 h >j ; \u2190\u2212 h >j ]> . In this way, the annotation hj contains the summaries\nof both the preceding words and the following words. Due to the tendency of RNNs to better represent recent inputs, the annotation hj will be focused on the words around xj . This sequence of annotations is used by the decoder and the alignment model later to compute the context vector (Eqs. (5)\u2013(6)).\nSee Fig. 1 for the graphical illustration of the proposed model."

This is a significant achievement, considering that Moses uses a separate monolingual corpus (418M words) in addition to the parallel corpora we used to train the RNNsearch and RNNencdec.\n6 We used the tokenization script from the open-source machine translation package, Moses. 7 In this paper, by a \u2019hidden unit\u2019, we always mean the gated hidden unit (see Appendix A.1.1).\nOne of the motivations behind the proposed approach was the use of a fixed-length context vector in the basic encoder\u2013decoder approach.

This is done by visualizing the annotation weights \u03b1ij from Eq. (6), as in Fig. 3. Each row of a matrix in each plot indicates the weights associated with the annotations. From this we see which positions in the source sentence were considered more important when generating the target word.\nWe can see from the alignments in Fig. 3 that the alignment of words between English and French is largely monotonic. We see strong weights along the diagonal of each matrix. However, we also observe a number of non-trivial, non-monotonic alignments. Adjectives and nouns are typically ordered differently between French and English, and we see an example in Fig. 3 (a). From this figure, we see that the model correctly translates a phrase [European Economic Area] into [zone e\u0301conomique europe\u0301en]. The RNNsearch was able to correctly align [zone] with [Area], jumping over the two words ([European] and [Economic]), and then looked one word back at a time to complete the whole phrase [zone e\u0301conomique europe\u0301enne].\nThe strength of the soft-alignment, opposed to a hard-alignment, is evident, for instance, from Fig. 3 (d). Consider the source phrase [the man] which was translated into [l\u2019 homme]. Any hard alignment will map [the] to [l\u2019] and [man] to [homme]. This is not helpful for translation, as one must consider the word following [the] to determine whether it should be translated into [le], [la], [les] or [l\u2019]. Our soft-alignment solves this issue naturally by letting the model look at both [the] and [man], and in this example, we see that the model was able to correctly translate [the] into [l\u2019]. We observe similar behaviors in all the presented cases in Fig. 3. An additional benefit of the soft alignment is that it naturally deals with source and target phrases of different lengths, without requiring a counter-intuitive way of mapping some words to or from nowhere ([NULL]) (see, e.g., Chapters 4 and 5 of Koehn, 2010)."

In his work, he used a mixture of Gaussian kernels to compute the weights of the annotations, where the location, width and mixture coefficient of each kernel was predicted from an alignment model. More specifically, his alignment was restricted to predict the location such that the location increases monotonically.\nThe main difference from our approach is that, in (Graves, 2013), the modes of the weights of the annotations only move in one direction. In the context of machine translation, this is a severe limitation, as (long-distance) reordering is often needed to generate a grammatically correct translation (for instance, English-to-German).\nOur approach, on the other hand, requires computing the annotation weight of every word in the source sentence for each word in the translation.

(2003) introduced a neural probabilistic language model which uses a neural network to model the conditional probability of a word given a fixed number of the preceding words, neural networks have widely been used in machine translation. However, the role of neural networks has been largely limited to simply providing a single feature to an existing statistical machine translation system or to re-rank a list of candidate translations provided by an existing system.\nFor instance, Schwenk (2012) proposed using a feedforward neural network to compute the score of a pair of source and target phrases and to use the score as an additional feature in the phrase-based statistical machine translation system. More recently, Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) and Devlin et al. (2014) reported the successful use of the neural networks as a sub-component of the existing translation system. Traditionally, a neural network trained as a target-side language model has been used to rescore or rerank a list of candidate translations (see, e.g., Schwenk et al., 2006).\nAlthough the above approaches were shown to improve the translation performance over the stateof-the-art machine translation systems, we are more interested in a more ambitious objective of designing a completely new translation system based on neural networks. The neural machine translation approach we consider in this paper is therefore a radical departure from these earlier works. Rather than using a neural network as a part of the existing system, our model works on its own and generates a translation from a source sentence directly."

We conjectured that the use of a fixed-length context vector is problematic for translating long sentences, based on a recent empirical study reported by Cho et al. (2014b) and Pouget-Abadie et al. (2014).\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel architecture that addresses this issue. We extended the basic encoder\u2013decoder by letting a model (soft-)search for a set of input words, or their annotations computed by an encoder, when generating each target word. This frees the model from having to encode a whole source sentence into a fixed-length vector, and also lets the model focus only on information relevant to the generation of the next target word. This has a major positive impact on the ability of the neural machine translation system to yield good results on longer sentences. Unlike with the traditional machine translation systems, all of the pieces of the translation system, including the alignment mechanism, are jointly trained towards a better log-probability of producing correct translations.\nWe tested the proposed model, called RNNsearch, on the task of English-to-French translation. The experiment revealed that the proposed RNNsearch outperforms the conventional encoder\u2013decoder model (RNNencdec) significantly, regardless of the sentence length and that it is much more robust to the length of a source sentence. From the qualitative analysis where we investigated the (soft-)alignment generated by the RNNsearch, we were able to conclude that the model can correctly align each target word with the relevant words, or their annotations, in the source sentence as it generated a correct translation.\nPerhaps more importantly, the proposed approach achieved a translation performance comparable to the existing phrase-based statistical machine translation. It is a striking result, considering that the proposed architecture, or the whole family of neural machine translation, has only been proposed as recently as this year. We believe the architecture proposed here is a promising step toward better machine translation and a better understanding of natural languages in general.\nOne of challenges left for the future is to better handle unknown, or rare words. This will be required for the model to be more widely used and to match the performance of current state-of-the-art machine translation systems in all contexts."

            "text": "A.1 ARCHITECTURAL CHOICES\nThe proposed scheme in Section 3 is a general framework where one can freely define, for instance, the activation functions f of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and the alignment model a. Here, we describe the choices we made for the experiments in this paper.\nA.1.1 RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK\nFor the activation function f of an RNN, we use the gated hidden unit recently proposed by Cho et al. (2014a). The gated hidden unit is an alternative to the conventional simple units such as an element-wise tanh. This gated unit is similar to a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit proposed earlier by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), sharing with it the ability to better model and learn long-term dependencies. This is made possible by having computation paths in the unfolded RNN for which the product of derivatives is close to 1. These paths allow gradients to flow backward easily without suffering too much from the vanishing effect (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2013a). It is therefore possible to use LSTM units instead of the gated hidden unit described here, as was done in a similar context by Sutskever et al. (2014).\nThe new state si of the RNN employing n gated hidden units8 is computed by\nsi = f(si\u22121, yi\u22121, ci) = (1\u2212 zi) \u25e6 si\u22121 + zi \u25e6 s\u0303i,\nwhere \u25e6 is an element-wise multiplication, and zi is the output of the update gates (see below). The proposed updated state s\u0303i is computed by\ns\u0303i = tanh (We(yi\u22121) + U [ri \u25e6 si\u22121] + Cci) ,\nwhere e(yi\u22121) \u2208 Rm is an m-dimensional embedding of a word yi\u22121, and ri is the output of the reset gates (see below). When yi is represented as a 1-of-K vector, e(yi) is simply a column of an embedding matrix E \u2208 Rm\u00d7K . Whenever possible, we omit bias terms to make the equations less cluttered.\nThe update gates zi allow each hidden unit to maintain its previous activation, and the reset gates ri control how much and what information from the previous state should be reset. We compute them by\nzi = \u03c3 (Wze(yi\u22121) + Uzsi\u22121 + Czci) ,\nri = \u03c3 (Wre(yi\u22121) + Ursi\u22121 + Crci) ,\nwhere \u03c3 (\u00b7) is a logistic sigmoid function. At each step of the decoder, we compute the output probability (Eq. (4)) as a multi-layered function (Pascanu et al., 2014). We use a single hidden layer of maxout units (Goodfellow et al., 2013) and normalize the output probabilities (one for each word) with a softmax function (see Eq. (6)).\nA.1.2 ALIGNMENT MODEL\nThe alignment model should be designed considering that the model needs to be evaluated Tx \u00d7 Ty times for each sentence pair of lengths Tx and Ty . In order to reduce computation, we use a singlelayer multilayer perceptron such that\na(si\u22121, hj) = v > a tanh (Wasi\u22121 + Uahj) ,\nwhere Wa \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, Ua \u2208 Rn\u00d72n and va \u2208 Rn are the weight matrices. Since Uahj does not depend on i, we can pre-compute it in advance to minimize the computational cost.\n8 Here, we show the formula of the decoder. The same formula can be used in the encoder by simply ignoring the context vector ci and the related terms.\nA.2 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL\nA.2.1 ENCODER\nIn this section, we describe in detail the architecture of the proposed model (RNNsearch) used in the experiments (see Sec. 4\u20135). From here on, we omit all bias terms in order to increase readability.\nThe model takes a source sentence of 1-of-K coded word vectors as input\nx = (x1, . . . , xTx), xi \u2208 RKx\nand outputs a translated sentence of 1-of-K coded word vectors\ny = (y1, . . . , yTy ), yi \u2208 RKy , where Kx and Ky are the vocabulary sizes of source and target languages, respectively. Tx and Ty respectively denote the lengths of source and target sentences.\nFirst, the forward states of the bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN) are computed:\n\u2212\u2192 h i =\n{ (1\u2212\u2212\u2192z i) \u25e6 \u2212\u2192 h i\u22121 + \u2212\u2192z i \u25e6 \u2212\u2192 h i , if i > 0\n0 , if i = 0\nwhere \u2212\u2192 h i =tanh (\u2212\u2192 WExi + \u2212\u2192 U [\u2212\u2192r i \u25e6 \u2212\u2192h i\u22121])\n\u2212\u2192z i =\u03c3 (\u2212\u2192 W zExi + \u2212\u2192 U z \u2212\u2192 h i\u22121 ) \u2212\u2192r i =\u03c3 (\u2212\u2192 W rExi + \u2212\u2192 U r \u2212\u2192 h i\u22121 ) .\nE \u2208 Rm\u00d7Kx is the word embedding matrix. \u2212\u2192 W, \u2212\u2192 W z, \u2212\u2192 W r \u2208 Rn\u00d7m, \u2212\u2192 U , \u2212\u2192 U z, \u2212\u2192 U r \u2208 Rn\u00d7n are weight matrices. m and n are the word embedding dimensionality and the number of hidden units, respectively. \u03c3(\u00b7) is as usual a logistic sigmoid function.\nThe backward states ( \u2190\u2212 h 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2190\u2212 h Tx) are computed similarly. We share the word embedding matrix E between the forward and backward RNNs, unlike the weight matrices.\nWe concatenate the forward and backward states to to obtain the annotations (h1, h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hTx), where\nhi = [ \u2212\u2192 h i\u2190\u2212 h i ] (7)\nA.2.2 DECODER\nThe hidden state si of the decoder given the annotations from the encoder is computed by\nsi =(1\u2212 zi) \u25e6 si\u22121 + zi \u25e6 s\u0303i, where\ns\u0303i =tanh (WEyi\u22121 + U [ri \u25e6 si\u22121] + Cci) zi =\u03c3 (WzEyi\u22121 + Uzsi\u22121 + Czci)\nri =\u03c3 (WrEyi\u22121 + Ursi\u22121 + Crci)\nE is the word embedding matrix for the target language. W,Wz,Wr \u2208 Rn\u00d7m, U,Uz, Ur \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, and C,Cz, Cr \u2208 Rn\u00d72n are weights. Again, m and n are the word embedding dimensionality and the number of hidden units, respectively. The initial hidden state s0 is computed by s0 = tanh ( Ws \u2190\u2212 h 1 ) , where Ws \u2208 Rn\u00d7n.\nThe context vector ci are recomputed at each step by the alignment model:\nci = Tx\u2211 j=1 \u03b1ijhj ,\nwhere\n\u03b1ij = exp (eij)\u2211Tx k=1 exp (eik) eij =v > a tanh (Wasi\u22121 + Uahj) ,\nand hj is the j-th annotation in the source sentence (see Eq. (7)). va \u2208 Rn \u2032 ,Wa \u2208 Rn \u2032\u00d7n and Ua \u2208 Rn\n\u2032\u00d72n are weight matrices. Note that the model becomes RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder (Cho et al., 2014a), if we fix ci to \u2212\u2192 h Tx .\nWith the decoder state si\u22121, the context ci and the last generated word yi\u22121, we define the probability of a target word yi as\np(yi|si, yi\u22121, ci) \u221d exp ( y>i Woti ) ,\nwhere\nti = [ max { t\u0303i,2j\u22121, t\u0303i,2j }]> j=1,...,l\nand t\u0303i,k is the k-th element of a vector t\u0303i which is computed by\nt\u0303i =Uosi\u22121 + VoEyi\u22121 + Coci.\nWo \u2208 RKy\u00d7l, Uo \u2208 R2l\u00d7n, Vo \u2208 R2l\u00d7m and Co \u2208 R2l\u00d72n are weight matrices. This can be understood as having a deep output (Pascanu et al., 2014) with a single maxout hidden layer (Goodfellow et al., 2013).\nA.2.3 MODEL SIZE\nFor all the models used in this paper, the size of a hidden layer n is 1000, the word embedding dimensionality m is 620 and the size of the maxout hidden layer in the deep output l is 500. The number of hidden units in the alignment model n\u2032 is 1000."

ForWa and Ua, we initialized them by sampling each element from the Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance 0.0012. All the elements of Va and all the bias vectors were initialized to zero. Any other weight matrix was initialized by sampling from the Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance 0.012.\nB.2 TRAINING\nWe used the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) was used to automatically adapt the learning rate of each parameter ( = 10\u22126 and \u03c1 = 0.95). We explicitly\nnormalized the L2-norm of the gradient of the cost function each time to be at most a predefined threshold of 1, when the norm was larger than the threshold (Pascanu et al., 2013b). Each SGD update direction was computed with a minibatch of 80 sentences.\nAt each update our implementation requires time proportional to the length of the longest sentence in a minibatch. Hence, to minimize the waste of computation, before every 20-th update, we retrieved 1600 sentence pairs, sorted them according to the lengths and split them into 20 minibatches. The training data was shuffled once before training and was traversed sequentially in this manner.\nIn Tables 2 we present the statistics related to training all the models used in the experiments."
