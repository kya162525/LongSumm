    "abstractText": "Observational studies are rising in importance due to the widespread accumulation of data in fields such as healthcare, education, employment and ecology. We consider the task of answering counterfactual questions such as, \u201cWould this patient have lower blood sugar had she received a different medication?\u201d. We propose a new algorithmic framework for counterfactual inference which brings together ideas from domain adaptation and representation learning. In addition to a theoretical justification, we perform an empirical comparison with previous approaches to causal inference from observational data. Our deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.",

            "text": "Inferring causal relations is a fundamental problem in the sciences and commercial applications. The problem of causal inference is often framed in terms of counterfactual questions (Lewis, 1973; Rubin, 1974; Pearl, 2009) such as \u201cWould this patient have lower blood sugar had she received a different medication?\u201d, or \u201cWould the user have clicked on this ad had it been in a different color?\u201d. In this paper we propose a method to learn representations suited for counterfactual inference, and show its efficacy in both simulated and real world tasks.\nWe focus on counterfactual questions raised by what are known as observational studies. Observational studies are studies where interventions and outcomes have been recorded, along with appropriate context. For example, consider an electronic health record dataset collected over\nProceedings of the 33 rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016. JMLR: W&CP volume 48. Copyright 2016 by the author(s).\nseveral years, where for each patient we have lab tests and past diagnoses, as well as data relating to their diabetic status, and the causal question of interest is which of two existing anti-diabetic medications A or B is better for a given patient. Observational studies are rising in importance due to the widespread accumulation of data in fields such as healthcare, education, employment and ecology. We believe machine learning will be called on more and more to help make better decisions in these fields, and that researchers should be careful to pay attention to the ways in which these studies differ from classic supervised learning, as explained in Section 2 below.\nIn this work we draw a connection between counterfactual inference and domain adaptation. We then introduce a form of regularization by enforcing similarity between the distributions of representations learned for populations with different interventions. For example, the representations for patients who received medication A versus those who received medication B. This reduces the variance from fitting a model on one distribution and applying it to another. In Section 3 we give several methods for learning such representations. In Section 4 we show our methods approximately minimizes an upper bound on a regret term in the counterfactual regime. The general method is outlined in Figure 1. Our work has commonalities with recent work on learning fair representations (Zemel et al., 2013; Louizos et al., 2015) and learning representations for transfer learning (Ben-David et al., 2007; Gani et al., 2015). In all these cases the learned representation has some invariance to specific aspects of the data: either an identity of a certain group such as racial minorities for fair representations, or the identity of the data source for domain adaptation, or, in the case of counterfactual learning, the type of intervention enacted in each population.\nIn machine learning, counterfactual questions typically arise in problems where there is a learning agent which performs actions, and receives feedback or reward for that\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n03 66\n1v 3\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n6 J\nun 2\nchoice without knowing what would be the feedback for other possible choices. This is sometimes referred to as bandit feedback (Beygelzimer et al., 2010). This setup comes up in diverse areas, for example off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998), learning from \u201clogged implicit exploration data\u201d (Strehl et al., 2010) or \u201clogged bandit feedback\u201d (Swaminathan & Joachims, 2015), and in understanding and designing complex real world ad-placement systems (Bottou et al., 2013). Note that while in contextual bandit or robotics applications the researcher typically knows the method underlying the action choice (e.g. the policy in reinforcement learning), in observational studies we usually do not have control or even a full understanding of the mechanism which chooses which actions are performed and which feedback or reward is revealed. For instance, for anti-diabetic medication, more affluent patients might be insensitive to the price of a drug, while less affluent patients could bring this into account in their choice.\nGiven that we do not know beforehand the particulars determining the choice of action, the question remains, how can we learn from data which course of action would have better outcomes. By bringing together ideas from representation learning and domain adaptation, our method offers a novel way to leverage increasing computation power and the rise of large datasets to tackle consequential questions of causal inference.\nThe contributions of our paper are as follows. First, we show how to formulate the problem of counterfactual inference as a domain adaptation problem, and more specifically a covariate shift problem. Second, we derive new families of representation algorithms for counterfactual inference: one is based on linear models and variable selection, and the other is based on deep learning of representations (Bengio et al., 2013). Finally, we show that learning representations that encourage similarity (balance) between the treated and control populations leads to better counterfactual inference; this is in contrast to many methods which attempt to create balance by re-weighting samples (e.g., Bang & Robins, 2005; Dud\u0131\u0301k et al., 2011; Austin, 2011; Swaminathan & Joachims, 2015). We show the merit of learning balanced representations both theoretically in Theorem 1, and empirically in a set of experiments across two datasets."

            "text": "Let T be the set of potential interventions or actions we wish to consider, X the set of contexts, and Y the set of possible outcomes. For example, for a patient x \u2208 X the set T of interventions of interest might be two different treatments, and the set of outcomes might be Y = [0, 200] indicating blood sugar levels in mg/dL. For an ad slot on a webpage x, the set of interventions T might be all possi-\nble ads in the inventory that fit that slot, while the potential outcomes could be Y = {click, no click}. For a context x (e.g. patient, webpage), and for each potential intervention t \u2208 T , let Yt(x) \u2208 Y be the potential outcome for x. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that only one potential outcome is observed for a given context x: even if we give the patient one medication and later the other, the patient is not in exactly the same state. In machine learning this type of partial feedback is often called \u201cbandit feedback\u201d. The model described above is known as the Rubin-Neyman causal model (Rubin, 1974; 2011).\nWe are interested in the case of a binary action set T = {0, 1}, where action 1 is often known as the \u201ctreated\u201d and action 0 is the \u201ccontrol\u201d. In this case the quantity Y1(x) \u2212 Y0(x) is of high interest: it is known as the individualized treatment effect (ITE) for context x (van der Laan & Petersen, 2007; Weiss et al., 2015). Knowing this quantity enables choosing the best of the two actions when confronted with the choice, for example choosing the best treatment for a specific patient. However, the fact that we only have access to the outcome of one of the two actions prevents the ITE from being known. Another commonly sought after quantity is the average treatment effect, ATE = Ex\u223cp(x)[ITE(x)] for a population with distribution p(x). In the binary action setting, we refer to the observed and unobserved outcomes as the factual outcome yF (x), and counterfactual outcome yCF (x) respectively.\nA common approach for estimating the ITE is by direct modelling: given n samples {(xi, ti, yFi )}ni=1, where yFi = ti \u00b7Y1(xi)+(1\u2212ti)Y0(xi), learn a function h : X\u00d7T \u2192 Y such that h(xi, ti) \u2248 yFi . The estimated transductive ITE is then:\n\u02c6ITE(xi) = { yFi \u2212 h(xi, 1\u2212 ti), ti = 1. h(xi, 1\u2212 ti)\u2212 yFi , ti = 0.\n(1)\nWhile in principle any function fitting model might be used for estimating the ITE (Prentice, 1976; Gelman & Hill, 2006; Chipman et al., 2010; Wager & Athey, 2015; Weiss et al., 2015), it is important to note how this task differs from standard supervised learning. The problem is as follows: the observed sample consists of the set P\u0302F = {(xi, ti)}ni=1. However, calculating the ITE requires inferring the outcome on the set P\u0302CF = {(xi, 1\u2212 ti)}ni=1. We call the set P\u0302F \u223c PF the empirical factual distribution, and the set P\u0302CF \u223c PCF the empirical counterfactual distribution, respectively. Because PF and PCF need not be equal, the problem of causal inference by counterfactual prediction might require inference over a different distribution than the one from which samples are given. In machine learning terms, this means that the feature distribution of the test set differs from that of the train set. This is a case of covariate shift, which is a special case of do-\nAlgorithm 1 Balancing counterfactual regression\n1: Input: X,T, Y F ;H,N ;\u03b1, \u03b3, \u03bb 2: \u03a6\u2217, g\u2217 = arg min\n\u03a6\u2208N ,g\u2208H BH,\u03b1,\u03b3(\u03a6, g) (2)\n3: h\u2217 = arg minh\u2208H 1 n \u2211n i=1(h(\u03a6, ti)\u2212 yFi )2 +\u03bb\u2016h\u2016H 4: Output: h\u2217,\u03a6\u2217\nmain adaptation (Daume III & Marcu, 2006; Jiang, 2008; Mansour et al., 2009). A somewhat similar connection was noted in Scho\u0308lkopf et al. (2012) with respect to covariate shift, in the context of a very simple causal model.\nSpecifically, we have that PF (x, t) = P (x) \u00b7 P (t|x) and PCF (x, t) = P (x) \u00b7 P (\u00act|x). The difference between the observed (factual) sample and the sample we must perform inference on lies precisely in the treatment assignment mechanism, P (t|x). For example, in a randomized control trial, we typically have that t and x are independent. In the contextual bandit setting, there is typically an algorithm which determines the choice of the action t given the context x. In observational studies, which are the focus of this work, the treatment assignment mechanism is not under our control and in general will not be independent of the context x. Therefore, in general, the counterfactual distribution will be different from the factual distribution."

            "text": "We propose to perform counterfactual inference by amending the direct modeling approach, taking into account the fact that the learned estimator h must generalize from the factual distribution to the counterfactual distribution.\nOur method, see Figure 1, learns a representation \u03a6 : X \u2192 Rd, (either using a deep neural network, or by feature reweighting and selection), and a function h : Rd \u00d7 T \u2192 R, such that the learned representation trades off three objectives: (1) enabling low-error prediction of the observed outcomes over the factual representation, (2) enabling lowerror prediction of unobserved counterfactuals by taking into account relevant factual outcomes, and (3) the distributions of treatment populations are similar or balanced.\nWe accomplish low-error prediction by the usual means of error minimization over a training set and regularization in order to enable good generalization error. We accomplish the second objective by a penalty that encourages counterfactual predictions to be close to the nearest observed outcome from the respective treated or control set. Finally, we accomplish the third objective by minimizing the so-called discrepancy distance, introduced by Mansour et al. (2009), which is a hypothesis class dependent distance measure tailored for domain adaptation. For hypothesis space H, we denote the discrepancy distance by discH. See Section 4 for the formal definition and motivation. Other discrepancy measures such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (Gretton et al., 2012) could also be used for this purpose.\nIntuitively, representations that reduce the discrepancy between the treated and control populations prevent the learner from using \u201cunreliable\u201d aspects of the data when trying to generalize from the factual to counterfactual domains. For example, if in our sample almost no men ever received medication A, inferring how men would react to medication A is highly prone to error and a more conservative use of the gender feature might be warranted.\nLet X = {xi}ni=1, T = {ti}ni=1, and Y F = {yFi }ni=1 denote the observed units, treatment assignments and factual outcomes respectively.

Let j(i) \u2208 arg minj\u2208{1...n} s.t. tj=1\u2212ti d(xj , xi) be the nearest neighbor of xi among the group that received the opposite treatment from unit i.

When the hypothesis class H is the class of linear functions, the term discH(P\u0302F\u03a6 , P\u0302 CF \u03a6 ) has a closed form brought in 4.1 below, and h(\u03a6, ti) = h>[\u03a6(xi) ti]. For more complex hypothesis spaces there is in general no exact closed form for discH(P\u0302F\u03a6 , P\u0302 CF \u03a6 ).\nOnce the representation \u03a6 is learned, we fit a final hypothesis minimizing a regularized squared loss objective on the factual data. Our algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. Note that our algorithm involves two minimization procedures. In Section 4 we motivate our method, by showing that our method of learning representations minimizes an upper bound on the regret error over the counterfactual distribution, using results of Cortes & Mohri (2014)."

            "text": "A na\u0131\u0308ve way of obtaining a balanced representation is to use only features that are already well balanced, i.e. features which have a similar distribution over both treated and control sets. However, imbalanced features can be highly predictive of the outcome, and should not always be discarded. A middle-ground is to restrict the influence of imbalanced features on the predicted outcome. We build on this idea by learning a sparse re-weighting of the features that minimizes the bound in Theorem 1. The re-weighting determines the influence of a feature by trading off its predictive capabilities and its balance.\nWe implement the re-weighting as a diagonal matrix W , forming the representation \u03a6(x) = Wx, with diag(W ) subject to a simplex constraint to achieve sparsity. LetN = {x 7\u2192 Wx : W = diag(w), wi \u2208 [0, 1], \u2211 i wi = 1} denote the space of such representations. We can now apply Algorithm 1 with Hl the space of linear hypotheses.

(6)\nThe proof is in the supplemental material.\nTheorem 1 gives, for all fixed representations \u03a6, a bound\non the relative error for a ridge regression model fit on the factual outcomes and evaluated on the counterfactual, as compared with ridge regression had it been fit on the unobserved counterfactual outcomes. It does not take into account how \u03a6 is obtained, and applies even if h(\u03a6(x), t) is not convex in x, e.g. if \u03a6 is a neural net. Since the bound in the theorem is true for all representations \u03a6, we can attempt to minimize it over \u03a6, as done in Algorithm 1.\nThe term on line (4) of the bound includes the unknown counterfactual outcomes yCFi . It measures how well could we in principle fit the factual and counterfactual outcomes together using a linear hypothesis over the representation \u03a6. For example, if the dimension of the representation is greater than the number of samples, and in addition if there exist constants b and such that |yFi \u2212 yCFi \u2212 b| \u2264 , then this term is upper bounded by . In general however, we cannot directly control its magnitude.\nThe term on line (3) measures the discrepancy between the factual and counterfactual distributions over the representation \u03a6. In 4.1 below, we show that this term is closely related to the norm of the difference in means between the representation of the control group and the treated group. A representation for which the means of the treated and control are close (small value of (3)), but at the same time allows for a good prediction of the factuals and counterfactuals (small value of (4)), is guaranteed to yield structural risk minimizers with similar generalization errors between factual and counterfactual.\nWe further show that the term on line (4), which cannot be evaluated since we do not know yCFi , can be upper bounded by a sum of the terms on lines (5) and (6). The term (5) includes two empirical data fitting terms: |y\u0302Fi (\u03a6, v)\u2212yFi | and |y\u0302CFi (\u03a6, v)\u2212yFj(i)|. The first is simply fitting the observed factual outcomes using a linear function over the representation \u03a6. The second term is a form of nearest-neighbor regression, where the counterfactual outcomes for a treated (resp. control) instance are fit to the most similar factual outcome among the control (resp. treated) set, where similarity is measured in the original space X . Finally, the term on line (6), is the only quantity which is independent of the representation \u03a6. It measures the average distance between each treated instance to the nearest control, and vice-versa, scaled by the Lipschitz constants of the true treated and control outcome functions. This term will be small when: (a) the true outcome functions Y0(x) and Y1(x) are relatively smooth, and (b) there is overlap between the treated and control groups, leading to small average nearest neighbor distance across the groups. It is well-known that when there is not much overlap between treated and control, causal inference in general is more difficult since the extrapolation from treated to control and vice-versa is more extreme (Rosenbaum, 2009).\nThe upper bound in Theorem 1 suggests the following approach for counterfactual regression. First minimize the terms (3) and (5) as functions of the representation \u03a6. Once \u03a6 is obtained, perform a ridge regression on the factual outcomes using the representations \u03a6(x) and the treatment assignments as input. The terms in the bound ensure that \u03a6 would have a good fit for the data (term (5)), while removing aspects of the treated and control which create a large discrepancy term (3)). For example, if there is a feature which is much more strongly associated with the treatment assignment than with the outcome, it might be advisable to not use it (Pearl, 2011)."

These methods include any type of regression including linear and logistic regression (Prentice, 1976; Gelman & Hill, 2006), random forests (Wager & Athey, 2015) and regression trees (Chipman et al., 2010).\nDoubly robust methods combine aspects of parametric and non-parametric methods, typically by using a propensity score weighted regression (Bang & Robins, 2005; Dud\u0131\u0301k et al., 2011). They are especially of use when the treatment assignment probability is known, as is the case for off-policy evaluation or learning from logged bandit data. Once the treatment assignment probability has to be estimated, as is the case in most observational studies, their efficacy might wane considerably (Kang & Schafer, 2007).\nTian et al.

We refer to the variable selection method of Section 3.1 as Balancing Linear Regression (BLR) and the neural network approach as BNN for Balancing Neural Network.\nWe report the RMSE of the estimated individual treatment effect, denoted ITE , and the absolute error in estimated average treatment effect, denoted ATE , see Section 2. Further, following Hill (2011), we report the Precision in Estimation of Heterogeneous Effect (PEHE), PEHE =\u221a\n1 n \u2211n i=1 (y\u03021(xi)\u2212 y\u03020(xi)\u2212 (Y1(xi)\u2212 Y0(xi)))\n2. Unlike for ITE, obtaining a good (small) PEHE requires accurate estimation of both the factual and counterfactual responses, not just the counterfactual. Standard methods for hyperparameter selection, including cross-validation, are unavailable when training counterfactual models on realworld data, as there are no samples from the counterfactual outcome. In our experiments, all outcomes are simulated, and we have access to counterfactual samples. To avoid fitting parameters to the test set, we generate multiple repeated experiments, each with a different outcome function and pick hyperparameters once, for all models (and baselines), based on a held-out set of experiments. While not possible for real-world data, this approach gives an indication of the robustness of the parameters.\nThe neural network architectures used for all experiments consist of fully-connected ReLU layers trained using RM-\nSProp, with a small l2 weight decay, \u03bb = 10\u22123. We evaluate two architectures. BNN-4-0 consists of 4 ReLU representation-only layers and a single linear output layer, dr = 4, do = 0. BNN-2-2 consists of 2 ReLU representation-only layers, 2 ReLU output layers after the treatment has been added, and a single linear output layer, dr = 2, do = 2, see Figure 2. For the IHDP data we use layers of 25 hidden units each. For the News data representation layers have 400 units and output layers 200 units. The nearest neighbor term, see Section 3, did not improve empirical performance, and was omitted for the BNN models. For the neural network models, the hypothesis and the representation were fit jointly.\nWe include several different linear models in our comparison, including ordinary linear regression (OLS) and doubly robust linear regression (DR) (Bang & Robins, 2005). We also include a method were variables are first selected using LASSO and then used to fit a ridge regression (LASSO + RIDGE). Regularization parameters are picked based on a held out sample. For DR, we estimate propensity scores using logistic regression and clip weights at 100. For the News dataset (see below), we perform the logistic regression on the first 100 principal components of the data.\nBayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) (Chipman et al., 2010) is a non-linear regression model which has been used successfully for counterfactual inference in the past (Hill, 2011). We compare our results to BART using the implementation provided in the BayesTree Rpackage (Chipman & McCulloch, 2016). Like (Hill, 2011), we do not attempt to tune the parameters, but use the default. Finally, we include a standard feed-forward neural network, trained with 4 hidden layers, to predict the factual outcome based on X and t, without a penalty for imbalance. We refer to this as NN-4."

The intervention t \u2208 {0, 1} represents the viewing device, desktop (t = 0) or mobile (t = 1). We assume that the consumer prefers to read about certain topics on mobile. To model this, we train a topic model on a large set of documents and let z(x) \u2208 Rk represent the topic distribution of news item x.

We show that trading off a balancing criterion with standard data fitting and regularization terms is both practically and theoretically prudent.\nOpen questions which remain are how to generalize this method for cases where more than one treatment is in question, deriving better optimization algorithms and using richer discrepancy measures."

Let di,j = d(xi, xj).\nThen for both Q = PF and Q = PCF we have:\n\u03bb\n\u00b5r (LQ(\u03b2\u0302F (\u03a6))\u2212 LQ(\u03b2\u0302CF (\u03a6)))2 \u2264 (10)\ndiscHl(P\u0302 F \u03a6 , P\u0302 CF \u03a6 )+\nmin h\u2208Hl\n1\nn n\u2211 i=1 ( |y\u0302Fi (\u03a6, h)\u2212 yFi |+ |y\u0302CFi (\u03a6, h)\u2212 yCFi | ) \u2264\n(11)\ndiscHl(P\u0302 F \u03a6 , P\u0302 CF \u03a6 )+\nmin h\u2208Hl\n1\nn n\u2211 i=1 ( |y\u0302Fi (\u03a6, h)\u2212 yFi |+ |y\u0302CFi (\u03a6, h)\u2212 yFj(i)| ) +\nK0 n \u2211 i:ti=1 di,j(i) + K1 n \u2211 i:ti=0 di,j(i).\nProof. Inequality (10) is immediate by Theorem A1. In order to prove inequality (11), we apply Lemma 1, setting b = y\u0302CFi and summing over the i."
