    "abstractText": "Molecular profiling data (e.g., gene expression) has been used for clinical risk prediction and biomarker discovery. However, it is necessary to integrate other prior knowledge like biological pathways or gene interaction networks to improve the predictive ability and biological interpretability of biomarkers. Here, we first introduce a general regularized Logistic Regression (LR) framework with regularized term \u03bb\u2016w\u20161 + \u03b7wMw, which can reduce to different penalties, including Lasso, elastic net, and network-regularized terms with different M . This framework can be easily solved in a unified manner by a cyclic coordinate descent algorithm which can avoid inverse matrix operation and accelerate the computing speed. However, if those estimated wi and wj have opposite signs, then the traditional network-regularized penalty may not perform well. To address it, we introduce a novel network-regularized sparse LR model with a new penalty \u03bb\u2016w\u20161 + \u03b7|w|M |w| to consider the difference between the absolute values of the coefficients. And we develop two efficient algorithms to solve it. Finally, we test our methods and compare them with the related ones using simulated and real data to show their efficiency. Index Terms \u2014Sparse logistic regression, network-regularized penalty, survival risk prediction, feature selection",

            "text": "P REDICTING clinical risk and discovering molecularprognostic signatures are key topics in genomic studies [1], [2]. Large number of genomic datasets (e.g., TCGA [3], [4]) have been rapidly generated on cancer and other complex disease [3], [5], [6], [7]. These available cancer genomic data provides us an unprecedented opportunity to predict the development risk of cancer via integrating diverse molecular profiling data [8], [5]. Recently, some prognostic models have been proposed via integrating clinical and gene expression data [9], [10], [11]. Most of these methods are based on the Cox proportional hazards model [12] and a few are designed based on other machine learning methods for this task. We can also easily dichotomize the survival time into a binary outcome and obtain a typical classification problem which can been solved by many supervised machine learning methods.\nLogistic regression (LR) is one of such a classical method and has been widely used for classification [13]. However the traditional LR model employs all (or most) variables for predicting and lead to a non-sparse solution with limited interpretability. The sparsity principle is an important strategy for interpretable analysis in statistics and machine learning. Recently, a number of studies have focused on developing regularized or penalized LR models to encourage sparse solutions and use a limited number of variables for\n\u2022 Wenwen Min, and Juan Liu are with the State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.

Many of the penalized LR models apply Lasso as a penalty function to induce sparsity. However the Lasso fails to select strongly correlated variables together and tends to select a variable from them [21]. Thus, many generalizations of the Lasso have been proposed to solve the limits of Lasso [22], including elastic net, group Lasso, and fused Lasso, etc. On the other hand, some researchers proposed refined regression models with network-based penalties [23], [24], [25]. These models are expect to get more accurate prediction and better interpretability via integrating prior knowledge.\nMotivated by the development of sparse coding and network-regularized norm [23], [26], we address the double tasks \u2013 feature selection and class prediction \u2013 by using a network-based penalty in the Logistic Regression (LR) framework. Specifically, we first focus on a traditional network-regularized penalty:\nR1(w) = \u03bb\u2016w\u20161 + \u03b7wTLw, (1) where L is the normalized Laplacian matrix encoding a prior network (e.g., a protein interaction network). The first term is a L1-norm penalty to induce sparsity. The second term wTLw = \u2211 i\u223cj Aij(wi/ \u221a di \u2212 wj/ \u221a dj)\n2 is a quadratic-Laplacian norm penalty to force the coefficients of w to be smooth. More importantly, it is a convex penalty. Thus, such a regularized LR model and its reduced forms can be solved effectively. However if those estimated wi and wj have opposite signs, then the traditional networkregularized penalty may not perform well. To address this limitation, we focus on a novel network-based penalty [27]:\nR2(w) = \u03bb\u2016w\u20161 + \u03b7|w|TL|w|, (2) where |w|TL|w| = \u2211i\u223cj Aij(|wi|/ \u221a di \u2212 |wj |/ \u221a dj) 2 which is adopted to eliminate the effects of symbols of the\n2 estimated coefficients. However, the novel penalty is not differentiable at the zero point. Intuitively, it is a challenge issue to solve such a regularized LR model using the conventional gradient descent method. Here we develop two methods to solve it. We first propose to use the following penalty:\n\u03bb\np\u2211\ni=1\n|wi|+ \u03b7 \u2211\ni\u223cj\nAij\n( sign(w\u0302i)wi\u221a\ndi \u2212 sign(w\u0302j)wj\u221a dj\n)2\nto replaceR2, i.e., |wi| \u2248 sign(w\u0302i)wi, where w\u0302 is computed using the maximum likelihood estimation for classical LR model. The new penalty is a convex function and has been used for a regression model [24]. Similarly, we can effectively solve this regularized LR model. We also try to solve the novel penalty (R2(w)) directly. Fortunately, Hastie et al. [28] (see Page 112) find that R2 has a good property (i.e., condition regularity [28], [29]), which inspires us to solve it via a cycle coordinate descent algorithm.\nTo sum up, our key contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce a unified Network-regularized Sparse LR (NSLR) framework enabling the Lasso, elastic net and networkregularized LR models are all special cases of it. More importantly, this framework can be efficiently solved using a coordinate-wise Newton algorithm. Second, we propose a novel network-regularized LR model to eliminate the sensitivity of the conventional network-regularized penalty to the signs of estimated coefficients. Here we adopt an approximate algorithm and a coordinate-wise Newton algorithm to solve it, respectively. Finally, we apply our methods to Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) gene expression and cancer clinical data from TCGA database [3], and a protein interaction network data from Pathway Commons [30] for survival risk prediction and biomarker discovery. Our first key is to identify some gene biomarkers for survival risk prediction. In addition, based on the prediction probability scores of GBM patients, we can divide them into different subtypes relating to survival output. Furthermore, we apply our methods to a lung cancer dataset with two subtypes including Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LUSC) to identify subtypespecific biomarkers."

Lastly, we propose a novel network-regularized sparse LR model in Section 2.5. We can use an approximate strategy (AdaNet.LR in Section 2.3) to solve it. In addition, we also develop an efficient coordinatewise Newton algorithm to solve the AdaNet.LR directly (Section 2.5)."

Here we collect a total of 525 GBM samples which are randomly divided into two subsets, including 350 training samples and 175 testing samples. We dichotomize the survival time of patients into clinical binary outcomes to formulate it into a classification problem. For each patient, we dichotomize its survival time into a binary outcome based on his/her survival time. For training samples, there are 57 censored patients kept for using in survival analysis. For testing samples, there are 32 censored patients. In the training process, we first remove those censored samples to train the regularized LR models. Then, we re-test all the training data and all the testing data (including censored samples) with the trained models. Based on the predicted LR scores computed via Pr(y = 1|x;w), we divide all the training and testing samples into different risk groups for further survival analysis.\nNote that the diagonal matrix \u039b and the vector z are updated using the following two formulas:\n\u039bii = p(xi;w old)(1\u2212 p(xi;wold)), (10)\nzi = x T i w\nold + yi \u2212 p(xi;wold)\n\u039bii . (11)\nSince XT\u039bX = (\u039b1/2X)T (\u039b1/2X) is a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix, we can obtain the optimal solution of linear system (9) via minimizing the following Quadratic Program (QP) problem:\nwnew = argmin w\n1 2 wT (XT\u039bX)w \u2212wT (XT\u039bz). (12)\nThat is to say that each Newton update step in Eq. (7) is equivalent to minimize a QP problem. To avoid inverse matrix operation, we apply a cyclic coordinate descent method [31], [32] to solve these QP problems. After a few steps of Newton update, we can get the optimal solution of Eq. (4). This process is also known as the iteratively re-weight least squares (IRLS) strategy [33], [34]."

We can solve this framework via the above IRLS strategy. In other words, each Newton update step of Eq. (13) is equivalent to solving a new QP problem. For convenience, we define the coefficient vector w = (w1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,wp) and \u03b8 = (w1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,wp, b), where b is the intercept. Then, the QP problem can be defined as follows:\nL(w, b) = 1 2n \u03b8T (XT\u039bX)\u03b8 \u2212 1 n \u03b8T (XT\u039bz) +R(w), (15) where R(w) is a generalized network-regularized penalty. With different M in R(w), the penalty reduces to different cases including Lasso, Elastic net and two networkregularized ones.\nCase 1: M = 0. The penalty function Eq. (14) reduces\nto R(w) = \u03bb p\u2211\ni=1 |wi|, which is the Lasso penalty [35]. We\ndenote this case as Lasso.LR. It has been widely used in bioinformatics [14], [15], [17]. However, Lasso has some potential limits [21]. For example, it fails to select strongly correlated variable group and only selects one variable from such group and ignores the others in it.\nCase 2: M = I. The penalty function Eq. (14) reduces\nto R(w) = \u03bb p\u2211\ni=1 |wi| + (1/2)\u03b7wTw, which is the so-called\n4 Elastic net penalty [21]. We denote this case as Elastic.LR which has adopted in [21]. However, to incorporate the known biological networks, a network-regularized penalty is needed in LR model.\nCase 3: M = L, where L = I \u2212 D1/2AD1/2 is a symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix and A \u2208 Rp\u00d7p is the adjacency matrix for a given prior network (e.g., a protein interaction network). If vertex i and vertex j are connected, then Aij = 1 and Aij = 0 otherwise. The degree of vertex i is defined by di = \u2211p j=1 Aij . Thus, L = (Lij) can be re-written as follows:\nLij =    1, if i = j and di 6= 0, \u2212 Aij\u221a didj , if i and j are connected,\n0, otherwise.\n(16)\nLi and Li [23] applied such a network-regularized regression model for analyzing genomic data. Zhang et al. [36] applied this penalty into the LR model for molecular pathway identification. We denote the Network-regularized LR model as Network.LR. They solve this model using the CVX package which was implemented for solving convex optimization problems [37]. In this paper, compared with the method based on CVX, we develop a simple coordinatewise Newton algorithm to avoid inverse matrix operation. However, the typical network-regularized penalty ignores that the pairwise variables of coefficients (linked in the prior network) may have opposite signs.\nCase 4: M = L\u2217. To consider the signs of the estimated vector w, we can adopt an adaptive network-based penalty R(w):\n\u03bb1\np\u2211\ni=1\n|wi|+ \u03b71 \u2211\ni\u223cj\nAij\n( sign(w\u0302i)wi\u221a\ndi \u2212 sign(w\u0302j)wj\u221a dj\n)2 ,\nwhere \u03bb1 = \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b71 = \u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1)\n2 and w\u0302 is computed using the maximum likelihood estimation for the classical LR model. It can considered as an approximation of |wj | using sign(w\u0302j)wj . At same time, L \u2217 can be re-written as:\nL\u2217ij =    1, if i = j and di 6= 0, \u2212 sign(w\u0302i)sign(w\u0302j)Aij\u221a didj , if i and j are connected,\n0, otherwise.\n(17)\nHere we denote the Adaptive Network-regularized LR as AdaNet.LR.\nIn addition to the four cases, we also consider a novel network-regularized penalty: R(w) = \u03bb\u2211pi=1 |wi| + \u03b7|w|TM |w| [27], to consider the opposite signs of pairwise variables directly. The new penalty can eliminate the sensitivity of the typical one to the signs of the feature correlation. However, it is non-differentiable at zero point and thus the general gradient descent method cannot solve AbsNet.LR directly. In the Section 2.5, we will introduce a clever way to solve it. Note that the AdaNet.LR model can be regarded as an approximation of the AbsNet.LR model."

The coordinate-wise descent strategy does not work for some penalties (e.g., fused lasso) [28]. However, Hastie et al.

Here we consider the level 3 expression data of TCGA which is quantified at the gene and transcript levels using RNA-Seq data by an expectation maximization method [44]. Then the expression values are log2-transformed. We first process the LUAD and LUSC gene expression data to keep the genes that are appeared in the KEGG pathway database from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [45]. Finally, we obtain 3230 genes related with 151 KEGG pathways. Here we consider each KEGG pathway as a fully connected subnetwork to build a prior network with 143438 edges."

            "text": "Here we apply all the methods to the lung cancer data to identify subtype-specific biomarkers. Compared to the integration of PPI network in the GBM data, we focus on the KEGG pathway as the prior information. We randomly select all the samples of 2/3 as the training samples and remaining ones are as the independent test samples. We show the results from all the regularized LR models in the independent training set (Table 4). In total, 69 genes are selected by the AbsNet.LR. All the genes identified by other regularized LR models (Lasso.LR, Elastic.LR, Network.LR and AdaNet.LR) are included in the 69 genes. The network-regularized LR models give similar results, which are superior to that of typical LR and Lasso.LR models. In addition, compared to the other network-regularized LR models, AbsNet.LR identifies a gene set with more edges in the KEGG pathway network.\nFurthermore, we evaluate the biological relevance of the identified 69 genes using the DAVID online web tool [38] and find several significantly enriched KEGG pathways relating to lung cancer, including metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (GSTA2, CYP3A5, CYP2F1, CYP3A7, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, UGT2A1) [46], linoleic acid metabolism (CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2C9, AKR1B10, CYP2C8) [47] and retinol metabolism (CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, UGT2A1, RPE65) [48] and so on."

            "heading": "7 CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this paper, we first introduce the typical networkregularized LR models with others in a unified framework. Although the typical network-regularized LR model can incorporate such prior information to get better biological interpretability, it fails to focus on the opposite effect of variables with different signs. To solve this limitation, we adopt a novel network-regularized penalty R = \u03bb\u2016w\u20161 + \u03b7|w|TL|w| into LR model (denoted as AbsNet.LR). However, the novel penalty is not differentiable\n9 at the zero point, enforcing it is hard to be solved using the typical gradient descent method. To this end, we first adapt the adaptive network-regularized penalty (note that it is convex) to approximate this novel network-regularized penalty and develop an adaptive network-regularized LR (AdaNet.LR) model which can be solved easily using the NSLR algorithm (Algorithm 1). We further find that the novel network-regularized penalty has a good property \u2013 condition regularity [28], [29], which inspires us to solve it via a cycle coordinate-wise Newton algorithm efficiently. We note that the binary LR-based classification models can be easily extended to the multiclass or multinomial classification problem [34], [49].\nApplications to the synthetic data show that the present methods are more effective compared to the typical ones. We also apply them to the GBM expression and a protein interaction network data to predict mortality probability of patients within one year. In addition, we apply them to a lung cancer expression data of two subtypes to identify subtype-specific biomarkers. We find a gene set with 69 genes which are tightly connected in the prior network. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes discovers a few KEGG pathways relating to the lung cancer clearly."
