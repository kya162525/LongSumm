    "abstractText": "Emotion cause extraction (ECE), the task aimed at extracting the potential causes behind certain emotions in text, has gained much attention in recent years due to its wide applications. However, it suffers from two shortcomings: 1) the emotion must be annotated before cause extraction in ECE, which greatly limits its applications in real-world scenarios; 2) the way to first annotate emotion and then extract the cause ignores the fact that they are mutually indicative. In this work, we propose a new task: emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE), which aims to extract the potential pairs of emotions and corresponding causes in a document. We propose a 2-step approach to address this new ECPE task, which first performs individual emotion extraction and cause extraction via multi-task learning, and then conduct emotion-cause pairing and filtering. The experimental results on a benchmark emotion cause corpus prove the feasibility of the ECPE task as well as the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "text": "Emotion cause extraction (ECE) aims at extracting potential causes that lead to emotion expressions in text. The ECE task was first proposed and defined as a word-level sequence labeling problem in Lee et al. (2010). To solve the shortcoming of extracting causes at word level, Gui et al. (2016a) released a new corpus which has received much attention in the following study and become a benchmark dataset for ECE research.\nFigure 1 displays an example from this corpus, There are five clauses in a document. The emotion \u201chappy\u201d is contained in the fourth clause. We denote this clause as emotion clause, which refers to a clause that contains emotions. It has two corresponding causes: \u201ca policeman visited the old man with the lost money\u201d in the second clause, and \u201ctold him that the thief was caught\u201d in the third\nclause. We denote them as cause clause, which refers to a clause that contains causes.\nThe ECE task was formalized as a clause-level binary classification problem in Gui et al. (2016a). The goal is to detect for each clause in a document, whether this clause is a cause given the annotation of emotion. This framework was followed by most of the recent studies in this field (Lee et al., 2010; Gui et al., 2016a; Li et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019).\nHowever, there are two shortcomings in the current ECE task. The first is that emotions must be annotated before cause extraction in the test set, which limits the applications of ECE in real-world scenarios. The second is that the way to first annotate the emotion and then extract the cause ignores the fact that emotions and causes are mutually indicative.\nIn this work, we propose a new task: emotioncause pair extraction (ECPE), which aims to extract all potential pairs of emotions and corresponding causes in a document. In Figure 1 we show the difference between the traditional ECE task and our new ECPE task. The goal of ECE is to extract the corresponding cause clause of the given emotion. In addition to a document as the input, ECE needs to provide annotated emotion at first before cause extraction. In contrast, the output of our ECPE task is a pair of emotioncause, without the need of providing emotion annotation in advance. Take Figure 1 for example, given the annotation of emotion: \u201chappy\u201d, the goal of ECE is to track the two corresponding cause clauses: \u201ca policeman visited the old man with the lost money\u201d and \u201cand told him that the thief was caught\u201d. While in the ECPE task, the goal is to directly extract all pairs of emotion clause and cause clause, including (\u201cThe old man was very happy\u201d, \u201ca policeman visited the old man with the lost money\u201d) and (\u201cThe old man was very happy\u201d, \u201cand told him that the thief was caught\u201d), without ar X iv :1 90 6. 01 26\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nJ un\n2 01\n9\nproviding the emotion annotation \u201chappy\u201d. To address this new ECPE task, we propose a two-step framework. Step 1 converts the emotioncause pair extraction task to two individual subtasks (emotion extraction and cause extraction respectively) via two kinds of multi-task learning networks, with the goal to extract a set of emotion clauses and a set of cause clauses. Step 2 performs emotion-cause pairing and filtering. We combine all the elements of the two sets into pairs and finally train a filter to eliminate the pairs that do not contain a causal relationship.\nWe evaluated our approach based on a benchmark emotion cause dataset (Gui et al., 2016a) without using emotion annotations on the test data. We finally achieve the F1 score of 61.28% in emotion-cause pair extraction. The experimental results prove the feasibility of the ECPE task and the effectiveness of our approach.\nIn addition to the emotion-cause pair extraction evaluation, we also evaluate the performance on two individual tasks (emotion extraction and cause extraction). Without relying on the emotion annotations on the test set, our approach achieves comparable cause extraction performance to traditional ECE methods (slightly lower than the stateof-the-art). In comparison with the traditional ECE methods that removes the emotion annotation dependence, our approach shows great advantages.\nThe main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a new task: emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE). It solves the shortcomings of the traditional ECE task that depends on the annotation of emotion before extracting cause, and allows emotion cause analysis to\nbe applied to real-world scenarios.\n\u2022 We propose a two-step framework to address the ECPE task, which first performs individual emotion extraction and cause extraction and then conduct emotion-cause pairing and filtering.\n\u2022 Based on a benchmark ECE corpus, we construct a corpus suitable for the ECPE task. The experimental results prove the feasibility of the ECPE task as well as the effectiveness of our approach."

            "text": "Lee et al. (2010) first presented the task of emotion cause extraction (ECE) and defined this task as extracting the word-level causes that lead to the given emotions in text. They constructed a smallscale Chinese emotion cause corpus in which the spans of both emotion and cause were annotated. Based on the same task settings, there were some other individual studies that conducted ECE research on their own corpus using rule based methods (Neviarouskaya and Aono, 2013; Li and Xu, 2014; Gao et al., 2015a,b; Yada et al., 2017) or machine learning methods (Ghazi et al., 2015; Song and Meng, 2015).\nChen et al. (2010) suggested that a clause may be the most appropriate unit to detect causes based on the analysis of the corpus in (Lee et al., 2010), and transformed the task from word-level to clause-level. They proposed a multi-label approach that detects multi-clause causes and captures the long-distance information. There were a lot of work based on this task setting. Russo et al. (2011) introduced a method based on the linguistic patterns and common sense knowledge for the identification of Italian sentences which contain a\ncause phrase. Gui et al. (2014) used 25 manually complied rules as features, and chose machine learning models, such as SVM and CRFs, to detect causes. Gui et al. (2016a), Gui et al. (2016b) and Xu et al. (2017) released a Chinese emotion cause dataset using SINA city news. This corpus has received much attention in the following study and has become a benchmark dataset for ECE research. Based on this corpus, several traditional machine learning methods (Gui et al., 2016a,b; Xu et al., 2017) and deep learning methods (Gui et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019) were proposed.\nIn addition, Cheng et al. (2017) focused on cause detection for Chinese microblogs using a multiple-user structure. They formalized two cause detection tasks for microblogs (currentsubtweet-based cause detection and originalsubtweet-based cause detection) and introduced SVM and LSTM to deal with them. Chen et al. (2018b) presented a neural network-based joint approach for emotion classification and cause detection in order to capture mutual benefits across these two sub-tasks. Chen et al. (2018a) proposed a hierarchical Convolution Neural Network (Hier-CNN), which used clause-level encoder and subtweet-level encoder to incorporate the word context features and event-based features respectively.\nAll of the above work attempts to extract wordlevel or clause-level causes given the emotion annotations. While our work is different from them, we propose to extract both the emotion and the corresponding causes at the same time (i.e., emotion-cause pair extraction) and to investigate whether indicating causes can improve emotion extraction and vice versa. Since we believe that cause and emotion are not mutually independent."

However, as we have mentioned, the two sub-tasks (emotion extraction and cause extraction) are not mutually independent. On the one hand, providing emotions can help better discover the causes; on the other hand, knowing causes may also help more accurately extract emotions.\nMotivated by this, we furthermore propose an interactive multi-task learning network, as an enhanced version of the former one, to capture the correlation between emotion and cause. The structure is shown in Figure 3. It should be noted that the method using emotion extraction to improve cause extraction is called Inter-EC. In addition, we can also use cause extraction to enhance emotion extraction, and call this method Inter-CE. Since Inter-EC and Inter-CE are similar in structure, we only introduce Inter-EC (illustrated in Figure 3 (a) ) instead of both.\nCompared with Independent Multi-task Learning, the lower layer of Inter-EC is unchanged, and the upper layer consists of two components, which are used to make predictions for emotion extraction task and cause extraction task in an interactive manner. Each component is a clause-level BiLSTM followed by a softmax layer.\nThe first component takes the independent clause representations [s1, s2, ..., s|d|] obtained at the lower layer as inputs for emotion extraction. The hidden state of clause-level Bi-LSTM rei is used as feature to predict the distribution of the i-th clause y\u0302ei .

            "text": "(1) Overall Performance\nIn Table 2, we report the experimental results of the following three proposed models on three tasks (emotion extraction, cause extraction and emotion-cause pair extraction).\n1http://www.aihuang.org/p/challenge.html 2The source code and merged corpus can be obtained at\nhttps://github.com/NUSTM/ECPE\n\u2022 Indep: Indep denotes the method proposed in section 4.1.1. In this method, emotion extraction and cause extraction are independently modeled by two Bi-LSTMs.\n\u2022 Inter-CE: Inter-CE denotes the method proposed in section 4.1.2, where the predictions of cause extraction are used to improve emotion extraction.\n\u2022 Inter-EC: Inter-EC denotes the method proposed in section 4.1.2, where the predictions of emotion extraction are used to enhance cause extraction.\nCompared with Indep, Inter-EC gets great improvements on the ECPE task as well as the two sub-tasks. Specifically, we find that the improvements are mainly in the recall rate on the cause extraction task, which finally lead to the great improvement in the recall rate of ECPE. This shows that the predictions of emotion extraction are helpful to cause extraction and proves the effectiveness of Inter-EC. In addition, the performance of emotion extraction also improved, which indicates that the supervision from cause extraction is also beneficial for emotion extraction.\nInter-CE also gets significant improvements on the ECPE task compared to Indep. Specifically, we find that the improvements are mainly in the precision score on the emotion extraction task, which finally lead to the significant improvement in the precision score of ECPE. This shows that the predictions of cause extraction are beneficial to emotion extraction and proves the effectiveness of Inter-CE.\nBy comparing Inter-EC and Inter-CE, we find that the improvement of Inter-EC is mainly obtained on the cause extraction task, and the im-\nprovement of Inter-CE is mainly gained on the emotion extraction task. These results are consistent with our intuition that emotion and cause are mutually indicative. In addition, we find that the improvements of Inter-EC on the cause extraction task are much more than the improvement of InterCE on the emotion extraction task. We guess that it is because cause extraction is more difficult than emotion extraction, hence there is more room for extra improvement.\n(2) Upper-Bound of Emotion and Cause Interaction\nIn order to further explore the effect of sharing predictions of two sub-tasks, we designed upperbound experiments for Inter-CE and Inter-EC. The results are shown in Table 3.\n\u2022 Inter-CE-Bound: Inter-CE-Bound is a variant of Inter-CE that uses the label of cause extraction to help emotion extraction.\n\u2022 Inter-EC-Bound: Inter-EC-Bound is a variant of Inter-EC that uses the label of emotion extraction to help cause extraction.\nThe results of Inter-CE-Bound and Inter-ECBound are preceded by a \u201c#\u201d, indicating that they cannot be compared fairly with other methods because they use annotations. Compared with Indep, the performance of Inter-EC-Bound on cause extraction and the performance of InterCE-Bound on emotion extraction both improve greatly. Moreover, the improvement of Inter-ECBound on the cause extraction task are much more than the improvement of Inter-CE-Bound on the emotion extraction task. We guess this is because the cause extraction task is more difficult than the\nemotion extraction task, and there is more room for improvement, which is consistent with previous section.\nBy comparing the results of Inter-EC-Bound and Inter-EC, we found that although Inter-EC performs better than Indep, it is far poorer than Inter-EC-Bound, which is caused by lots of errors in the predictions of emotion extraction. We can draw the same conclusion when comparing InterCE-Bound and Inter-CE.\nThese experimental results further illustrate that emotion and cause are mutually indicative, and indicate that if we can improve the performance of emotion extraction task, we can get better performance on cause extraction task and vice versa, which finally lead to the improvement on ECPE. But it should be noted it is only an upperbound experiment where the ground-truth of emotion/causes are used to predict each other.\n(3) Effect of Emotion-Cause Pair Filtering In Table 4, we report the emotion-cause pair extraction performance with/without pair filtering. With/Without pair filtering indicates whether we adopt a pair filter after applying a Cartesian product in the second step. keep rate indicates the proportion of emotion-cause pairs in Pall that are finally retained after pair filtering.\nAn obvious observation is that the F1 scores of all models on the ECPE task are significantly improved by adopting the pair filter. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pair filter. Specifically, by introducing the pair filter, some of the candidate emotion-cause pairs in Pall are filtered out, which may result in a decrease in the recall rate and an increase in precision. According to Table 4, the precision scores of almost\nall models are greatly improved (more than 7%), in contrast, the recall rates drop very little (less than 1%), which lead to the significant improvement in F1 score."

This indicates that our method can overcome the limitation that\nemotion annotations must be given at the testing phase in the traditional ECE task, but without reducing the cause extraction performance.\nIn order to compare with the traditional methods for the ECE task under the same experimental settings, we furthermore implemented a simplification of CANN (CANN-E), which removes the dependency of emotion annotation in the test data.\nIt is clear that by removing the emotion annotations, the F1 score of CANN drops dramatically (about 34.69%). In contrast, our method does not need the emotion annotations and achieve 65.07% in F1 measure, which significantly outperforms the CANN-E model by 27.1%."

Based on a benchmark ECE corpus, we construct a corpus suitable for the ECPE task. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method.\nThe two-step strategy may not be a perfect solution to solve the ECPE problem. On the one hand, its goal is not direct. On the other hand, the mistakes made in the first step will affect the results of the second step. In the future work, we will try to build a one-step model that directly extract the emotion-cause pairs in an end-to-end fashion."
