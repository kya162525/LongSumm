Max-pooling act on the hidden layers of the network, reducing their size by an integer multiplicative factor \u03b1. The amazing by-product of discarding 75% of your data is that you build into the network a degree of invariance with respect to translations and elastic distortions. However, if you simply alternate convolutional layers with max-pooling layers, performance is limited due to the rapid reduction in spatial size, and the disjoint nature of the pooling regions. We have formulated a fractional version of maxpooling where \u03b1 is allowed to take non-integer values. Our version of max-pooling is stochastic as there are lots of different ways of constructing suitable pooling regions. We find that our form of fractional max-pooling reduces overfitting on a variety of datasets: for instance, we improve on the state of the art for CIFAR-100 without even using dropout. 1 Convolutional neural networks Convolutional networks are used to solve image recognition problems. They can be built by combining two types of layers: \u2022 Layers of convolutional filters. \u2022 Some form of spatial pooling, such as max-pooling. Research focused on improving the convolutional layers has lead to a wealth of techniques such as dropout [10], DropConnect [12], deep networks with many small filters[2], large input layer filters for detecting texture [5], and deeply supervised networks [6]. By comparison, the humble pooling operation has been slightly neglected. For a long time 2\u00d7 2 max-pooling (MP2 has been the default choice for building convolutional networks.

However, the disjoint nature of the pooling regions can limit generalization. Additionally, as MP2-pooling reduces the size of the hidden layers so quickly, stacks of back-to-back convolutional layers are needed to build really deep networks [7, 9, 11]. Two methods that have been proposed to overcome this problems are: \u2022 Using 3\u00d7 3 pooling regions overlapping with stride 2 [5]. \u2022 Stochastic pooling, where the act of picking the maximum value in each pooling region is replaced by a form of size-biased sampling [13]. However, both these techniques still reduce the size of the hidden layers by a factor of two. It seems natural to ask if spatial-pooling can usefully be applied in a gentler manner. If pooling was to only reduce the size of the hidden layers by a factor of \u221a 2, then we could use twice as many layers of pooling. Each layer of pooling is an opportunity to view the input image at a different scale. Viewing images at the \u2018right\u2019 scale should make it easier to recognize the tell-tale features that identify an object as belonging to a particular class. The focus of this paper is thus a particular form of max-pooling that we call fractional max-pooling (FMP). The idea of FMP is to reduce the spatial size of the image by a factor of \u03b1 with 1 < \u03b1 < 2. Like stochastic pooling, FMP introduces a degree of randomness to the pooling process. However, unlike stochastic-pooling, the randomness is related to the choice of pooling regions, not the way pooling is performed inside each of the pooling regions. In Section 2 we give a formal description of fractional max-pooling. Briefly, there are three choices that affect the way FMP is implemented: \u2022 The pooling fraction \u03b1 which determines the ratio between the spatial sizes of the input and the output of the pooling layer. Regular 2 \u00d7 2 max-pooling corresponds to the special case \u03b1 = 2. \u2022 The pooling regions can either be chosen in a random or a pseudorandom fashion. There seems to be a trade off between the use of randomness in FMP and the use of dropout and/or training data augmentation. RandomFMP seems to work better on its own; however, when combined with \u2018too much\u2019 dropout or training data augmentation, underfitting can occur. \u2022 The pooling regions can be either disjoint or overlapping. Disjoint regions are easier to picture, but we find that overlapping regions work better. In Section 3 we describe how our convolutional networks were designed and trained. In Section 4 we give results for the MNIST digits, the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets of small pictures, handwritten Assamese characters and the CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset of handwritten Chinese characters. 2 Fractional max-pooling Each convolutional filter of a CNN produces a matrix of hidden variables.

Max-pooling is\na procedure that takes an Nin \u00d7Nin input matrix and returns a smaller output matrix, say Nout\u00d7Nout. This is achieved by dividing the Nin\u00d7Nin square into N2out pooling regions (Pi,j):\nPi,j \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , Nin}2 for each (i, j) \u2208 {1, . . . , Nout}2,\nand then setting Outputi,j = max\n(k,l)\u2208Pi,j Inputk,l.\nFor regular 2\u00d72 max-pooling, Nin = 2Nout and Pi,j = {2i\u22121, 2i}\u00d7{2j\u22121, 2j}. In [5], max-pooling is applied with overlapping 3 \u00d7 3 pooling regions so Nin = 2Nout + 1 and the Pi,j are 3 \u00d7 3 squares, tiled with stride 2. In both cases, Nin/Nout \u2248 2 so the spatial size of any interesting features in the input image halve in size with each pooling layer. In contrast, if we take Nin/Nout \u2248 n \u221a 2 then the rate of decay of the spatial size of interesting features is n times slower. For clarity we will now focus on the case Nin/Nout \u2208 (1, 2) as we are primarily interested in accuracy; if speed is an overbearing concern then FMP could be applied with Nin/Nout \u2208 (2, 3).\nGiven a particular pair of values (Nin, Nout) we need a way to choose pooling regions (Pi,j). We will consider two type of arrangements, overlapping squares and disjoint collections of rectangles. In Figure 1 we show a number of different ways of dividing up a 36 \u00d7 36 square grid into disjoint rectangles. Pictures two, three and six in Figure 1 can also be used to define an arrangement of overlapping 2\u00d7 2 squares: take the top left hand corner of each rectangle in the picture to be the top left hand corner of one of the squares.\nTo give a formal description of how to generate pooling regions, let (ai)Nouti=0 and (bi)Nouti=0 be two increasing sequence of integers starting at 1, ending with Nin, and with increments all equal to one or two (i.e. ai+1 \u2212 ai \u2208 {1, 2}). The regions can then be defined by either\nP = [ai\u22121, ai \u2212 1]\u00d7 [bj\u22121, bj \u2212 1] or Pi,j = [ai\u22121, ai]\u00d7 [bj\u22121, bj ]. (1)\nWe call the two cases disjoint and overlapping, respectively. We have tried two different approaches for generating the integer sequence: using random sequences of numbers and also using pseudorandom sequences.\nWe will say that the sequences are random if the increments are obtained by taking a random permutation of an appropriate number of ones and twos. We will say that the sequences are pseudorandom if they take the form\nai = ceiling(\u03b1(i+ u)), \u03b1 \u2208 (1, 2), with some u \u2208 (0, 1).\nBelow are some patterns of increments corresponding to the case Nin = 25, Nout = 18.

This is similar to dropout [10]; the different values the dropout mask can take define an ensemble of related networks. As with\ndropout, model averaging for FMP networks can help improve performance. If you classify the same test image a number of times, you may get a number of different predictions.

            "text": "We have trained convolutional networks with fractional max-pooling on a number of popular datasets and found substantial improvements in performance. Overlapping FMP seems to be better than disjoint FMP. Pseudorandom pooling regions seem to do better than random pooling regions when training data augmentation is used. It is possible that random pooling might regain the upperhand if we fine-tuned the amount of dropout used.\nLooking again at the distortions created by random pooling in Figure 2, note that the distortion is \u2018decomposable\u2019 into an x-axis distortion and a y-axis distortion. It might be interesting to explore pooling regions that cannot be written using equation 1, as they might encode more general kinds of distortion into the resulting convolutional networks."
