    "abstractText": "We consider the problem of Bayesian parameter estimation for deep neural networks, which is important in problem settings where we may have little data, and/ or where we need accurate posterior predictive densities p(y|x,D), e.g., for applications involving bandits or active learning. One simple approach to this is to use online Monte Carlo methods, such as SGLD (stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics). Unfortunately, such a method needs to store many copies of the parameters (which wastes memory), and needs to make predictions using many versions of the model (which wastes time). We describe a method for \u201cdistilling\u201d a Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior predictive density into a more compact form, namely a single deep neural network. We compare to two very recent approaches to Bayesian neural networks, namely an approach based on expectation propagation [HLA15] and an approach based on variational Bayes [BCKW15]. Our method performs better than both of these, is much simpler to implement, and uses less computation at test time.",

            "text": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state of the art results in many fields. However, their predictions are often over confident, which is a problem in applications such as active learning, reinforcement learning (including bandits), and classifier fusion, which all rely on good estimates of uncertainty.\nA principled way to tackle this problem is to use Bayesian inference. Specifically, we first compute the posterior distribution over the model parameters, p(\u03b8|DN ) \u221d p(\u03b8) \u220fN i=1 p(yi|xi, \u03b8), where DN = {(xi, yi)}Ni=1, xi \u2208 XD is the i\u2019th input (where D is the number of features), and yi \u2208 Y is the i\u2019th output. Then we compute the posterior predictive distribution, p(y|x,DN ) =\u222b p(y|x, \u03b8)p(\u03b8|DN )d\u03b8, for each test point x.\nFor reasons of computational speed, it is common to approximate the posterior distribution by a point estimate such as the MAP estimate, \u03b8\u0302 = argmax p(\u03b8|DN ). When N is large, we often use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to compute \u03b8\u0302. Finally, we make a plug-in approximation to the predictive distribution: p(y|x,DN ) \u2248 p(y|x, \u03b8\u0302). Unfortunately, this loses most of the benefits of the Bayesian approach, since uncertainty in the parameters (which induces uncertainty in the predictions) is ignored.\nVarious ways of more accurately approximating p(\u03b8|DN ) (and hence p(y|x,DN )) have been developed. Recently, [HLA15] proposed a method called \u201cprobabilistic backpropagation\u201d (PBP) based on an online version of expectation propagation (EP), (i.e., using repeated assumed density filtering (ADF)), where the posterior is approximated as a product of univariate Gaussians, one per parameter: p(\u03b8|DN ) \u2248 q(\u03b8) , \u220f iN (\u03b8i|mi, vi).\nAn alternative to EP is variational Bayes (VB) where we optimize a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. [Gra11] presented a (biased) Monte Carlo estimate of this lower bound and applies\nhis method, called \u201cvariational inference\u201d (VI), to infer the neural network weights. More recently, [BCKW15] proposed an approach called \u201cBayes by Backprop\u201d (BBB), which extends the VI method with an unbiased MC estimate of the lower bound based on the \u201creparameterization trick\u201d of [KW14, RMW14]. In both [Gra11] and [BCKW15], the posterior is approximated by a product of univariate Gaussians.\nAlthough EP and VB scale well with data size (since they use online learning), there are several problems with these methods: (1) they can give poor approximations when the posterior p(\u03b8|DN ) does not factorize, or if it has multi-modality or skew; (2) at test time, computing the predictive density p(y|x,DN ) can be much slower than using the plug-in approximation, because of the need to integrate out the parameters; (3) they need to use double the memory of a standard plug-in method (to store the mean and variance of each parameter), which can be problematic in memory-limited settings such as mobile phones; (4) they can be quite complicated to derive and implement.\nA common alternative to EP and VB is to use MCMC methods to approximate p(\u03b8|DN ). Traditional MCMC methods are batch algorithms, that scale poorly with dataset size. However, recently a method called stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) [WT11] has been devised that can draw samples approximately from the posterior in an online fashion, just as SGD updates a point estimate of the parameters online. Furthermore, various extensions of SGLD have been proposed, including stochastic gradient hybrid Monte Carlo (SGHMC) [CFG14], stochastic gradient Nose\u0301-Hoover Thermostat (SG-NHT) [DFB+14] (which improves upon SGHMC), stochastic gradient Fisher scoring (SGFS) [AKW12] (which uses second order information), stochastic gradient Riemannian Langevin Dynamics [PT13], distributed SGLD [ASW14], etc. However, in this paper, we will just use \u201cvanilla\u201d SGLD [WT11].1\nAll these MCMC methods (whether batch or online) produce a Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior, q(\u03b8) = 1S \u2211S s=1 \u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8s), where S is the number of samples. Such an approximation can be more accurate than that produced by EP or VB, and the method is much easier to implement (for SGLD, you essentially just add Gaussian noise to your SGD updates). However, at test time, things are S times slower than using a plug-in estimate, since we need to compute q(y|x) = 1S \u2211S s=1 p(y|x, \u03b8s), and the memory requirements are S times bigger, since we need to store the \u03b8s. (For our largest experiment, our DNN has 500k parameters, so we can only afford to store a single sample.)\nIn this paper, we propose to train a parametric model S(y|x,w) to approximate the Monte Carlo posterior predictive distribution q(y|x) in order to gain the benefits of the Bayesian approach while only using the same run time cost as the plugin method. Following [HVD14], we call q(y|x) the \u201cteacher\u201d and S(y|x,w) the \u201cstudent\u201d. We use SGLD2 to estimate q(\u03b8) and hence q(y|x) online; we simultaneously train the student online to minimize KL(q(y|x)||S(y|x,w)). We give the details in Section 2.\nSimilar ideas have been proposed in the past. In particular, [SG05] also trained a parametric student model to approximate a Monte Carlo teacher. However, they used batch training and they used mixture models for the student. By contrast, we use online training (and can thus handle larger datasets), and use deep neural networks for the student.\n[HVD14] also trained a student neural network to emulate the predictions of a (larger) teacher network (a process they call \u201cdistillation\u201d), extending earlier work of [BCNM06] which approximated an ensemble of classifiers by a single one. The key difference from our work is that our teacher is generated using MCMC, and our goal is not just to improve classification accuracy, but also to get reliable probabilistic predictions, especially away from the training data. [HVD14] coined the term \u201cdark knowledge\u201d to represent the information which is \u201chidden\u201d inside the teacher network, and which can then be distilled into the student. We therefore call our approach \u201cBayesian dark knowledge\u201d.\n1 We did some preliminary experiments with SG-NHT for fitting an MLP to MNIST data, but the results were not much better than SGLD.\n2Note that SGLD is an approximate sampling algorithm and introduces a slight bias in the predictions of the teacher and student network. If required, we can replace SGLD with an exact MCMC method (e.g. HMC) to get more accurate results at the expense of more training time.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows. First, we show how to combine online MCMC methods with model distillation in order to get a simple, scalable approach to Bayesian inference of the parameters of neural networks (and other kinds of models). Second, we show that our probabilistic predictions lead to improved log likelihood scores on the test set compared to SGD and the recently proposed EP and VB approaches."

However, we can approximate this by Monte Carlo:\nL\u0302(w|x) = \u2212 1 |\u0398| \u2211 \u03b8s\u2208\u0398 Ep(y|x,\u03b8s) logS(y|x,w) (2)\nwhere \u0398 is a set of samples from p(\u03b8|DN ). To make this a function just of w, we need to integrate out x. For this, we need a dataset to train the student network on, which we will denote by D\u2032. Note that points in this dataset do not need ground truth labels; instead the labels (which will be probability distributions) will be provided by the teacher. The choice of student data controls the domain over which the student will make accurate predictions. For low dimensional problems (such as in Section 3.1), we can uniformly sample the input domain. For higher dimensional problems, we can sample \u201cnear\u201d the training data, for example by perturbing the inputs slightly. In any case, we will compute a Monte Carlo approximation to the loss as follows:\nL\u0302(w) = \u222b p(x)L(w|x)dx \u2248 1 |D\u2032| \u2211 x\u2032\u2208D\u2032 L(w|x\u2032)\n\u2248 \u2212 1 |\u0398| 1 |D\u2032| \u2211 \u03b8s\u2208\u0398 \u2211 x\u2032\u2208D\u2032 Ep(y|x\u2032,\u03b8s) logS(y|x\u2032, w) (3)\nIt can take a lot of memory to pre-compute and store the set of parameter samples \u0398 and the set of data samples D\u2032, so in practice we use the stochastic algorithm shown in Algorithm 1, which uses a single posterior sample \u03b8s and a minibatch of x\u2032 at each step.\nThe hyper-parameters \u03bb and \u03b3 from Algorithm 1 control the strength of the priors for the teacher and student networks. We use simple spherical Gaussian priors (equivalent to L2 regularization); we set the precision (strength) of these Gaussian priors by cross-validation. Typically \u03bb \u03b3, since the student gets to \u201csee\u201d more data than the teacher. This is true for two reasons: first, the teacher is trained to predict a single label per input, whereas the student is trained to predict a distribution, which contains more information (as argued in [HVD14]); second, the teacher makes multiple passes over the same training data, whereas the student sees \u201cfresh\u201d randomly generated data D\u2032 at each step."

We generate a synthetic dataset in 2 dimensions with 2 classes, 10 points per class. We then fit a multi layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer of 10 ReLu units and 2 softmax outputs (denoted 2-10-2) using SGD. The resulting predictions are shown in Figure 1(a). We see the expected sigmoidal probability ramp orthogonal to the linear decision boundary. Unfortunately, this method predicts a label of 0 or 1 with very high confidence, even for points that are far from the training data (e.g., in the top left and bottom right corners).\nIn Figure 1(b), we show the result of HMC using 20k samples. This is the \u201ctrue\u201d posterior predictive density which we wish to approximate. In Figure 1(c), we show the result of SGLD using about 1000 samples. Specifically, we generate 100k samples, discard the first 2k for burnin, and then keep every 100\u2019th sample. We see that this is a good approximation to the HMC distribution.\nIn Figures 1(d-f), we show the results of approximating the SGLD Monte Carlo predictive distribution with a single student MLP of various sizes. To train this student network, we sampled points at random from the domain of the input, [\u221210, 10] \u00d7 [\u221210, 10]; this encourages the student to predict accurately at all locations, including those far from the training data.

First, the open source code for the EP approach only supports regression, so we could not evaluate this on classification problems.

Third, HMC is too slow to run on large problems, so we just applied it to the small \u201ctoy\u201d problems. Nevertheless, our experiments show that our methods compare favorably to these other methods.\nsize as the teacher (2-10-2), but this is too simple a model to capture the complexity of the predictive distribution (which is an average over models). In (e), the student has a larger hidden layer (2-100- 2); this works better. However, we get best results using a two hidden layer model (2-10-10-2), as shown in (f).\nIn Table 2, we show the KL divergence between the HMC distribution (which we consider as ground truth) and the various approximations mentioned above. We computed this by comparing the probability distributions pointwise on a 2d grid. The numbers match the qualitative results shown in Figure 1."

            "heading": "3.2 MNIST classification",
            "text": "Now we consider the MNIST digit classification problem, which has N = 60k examples, 10 classes, and D = 784 features. The only preprocessing we do is divide the pixel values by 126 (as in [BCKW15]). We train only on 50K datapoints and use the remaining 10K for tuning hyperparameters. This means our results are not strictly comparable to a lot of published work, which uses the whole dataset for training; however, the difference is likely to be small.\nFollowing [BCKW15], we use an MLP with 2 hidden layers with 400 hidden units per layer, ReLU activations, and softmax outputs; we denote this by 784-400-400-10. This model has 500k parameters.\nWe first fit this model by SGD, using these hyper parameters: fixed learning rate of \u03b7t = 5\u00d7 10\u22126, prior precision \u03bb = 1, minibatch size M = 100, number of iterations T = 1M . As shown in Table 3, our final error rate on the test set is 1.536%, which is a bit lower than the SGD number reported in [BCKW15], perhaps due to the slightly different training/ validation configuration.\nNext we fit this model by SGLD, using these hyper parameters: fixed learning rate of \u03b7t = 4\u00d710\u22126, thinning interval \u03c4 = 100, burn in iterations B = 1000, prior precision \u03bb = 1, minibatch size M = 100. As shown in Table 3, our final error rate on the test set is about 1.271%, which is better than the SGD, dropout and BBB results from [BCKW15].5\nFinally, we consider using distillation, where the teacher is an SGLD MC approximation of the posterior predictive. We use the same 784-400-400-10 architecture for the student as well as the teacher. We generate data for the student by adding Gaussian noise (with standard deviation of 0.001) to randomly sampled training points6 We use a constant learning rate of \u03c1 = 0.005, a batch size of M = 100, a prior precision of 0.001 (for the student) and train for T = 1M iterations. We obtain a test error of 1.307% which is very close to that obtained with SGLD (see Table 4).\n5 We only show the BBB results with the same Gaussian prior that we use. Performance of BBB can be improved using other priors, such as a scale mixture of Gaussians, as shown in [BCKW15]. Our approach could probably also benefit from such a prior, but we did not try this.\n6In the future, we would like to consider more sophisticated data perturbations, such as elastic distortions.\nWe also report the average test log-likelihood of SGD, SGLD and distilled SGLD in Table 4. The log-likelihood is equivalent to the logarithmic scoring rule [Bic07] used in assessing the calibration of probabilistic models. The logarithmic rule is a strictly proper scoring rule, meaning that the score is uniquely maximized by predicting the true probabilities. From Table 4, we see that both SGLD and distilled SGLD acheive higher scores than SGD, and therefore produce better calibrated predictions.\nNote that the SGLD results were obtained by averaging predictions from \u2248 10,000 models sampled from the posterior, whereas distillation produces a single neural network that approximates the average prediction of these models, i.e. distillation reduces both storage and test time costs of SGLD by a factor of 10,000, without sacrificing much accuracy. In terms of training time, SGD took 1.3 ms, SGLD took 1.6 ms and distilled SGLD took 3.2 ms per iteration. In terms of memory, distilled SGLD requires only twice as much as SGD or SGLD during training, and the same as SGD during testing."
