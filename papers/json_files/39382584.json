    "abstractText": "Paper-by-paper results make it easy to miss the forest for the trees.We analyse the remarkable progress of the last decade by discussing the main ideas explored in the 40+ detectors currently present in the Caltech pedestrian detection benchmark. We observe that there exist three families of approaches, all currently reaching similar detection quality. Based on our analysis, we study the complementarity of the most promising ideas by combining multiple published strategies. This new decision forest detector achieves the current best known performance on the challenging Caltech-USA dataset.",

            "text": "1 Introduction\nPedestrian detection is a canonical instance of object detection. Because of its direct applications in car safety, surveillance, and robotics, it has attracted much attention in the last years. Importantly, it is a well defined problem with established benchmarks and evaluation metrics. As such, it\nhas served as a playground to explore different ideas for object detection. The main paradigms for object detection \u201cViola&Jones variants\u201d, HOG+SVM rigid templates, deformable part detectors (DPM), and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have all been explored for this task.\nThe aim of this paper is to review progress over the last decade of pedestrian detection (40+ methods), identify the main ideas explored, and try to quantify which ideas had the most impact on final detection quality. In the next sections we review existing datasets (section 2), provide a discussion of the different approaches (section 3), and experiments reproducing/quantifying the recent years\u2019 progress (section 4, presenting experiments over \u223c 20 newly trained detector models). Although we do not aim to introduce a novel technique, by putting together existing methods we report the best known detection results on the challenging Caltech-USA dataset.\nar X\niv :1\n41 1.\n43 04\nv1 [\ncs .C"

            "text": "Multiple public pedestrian datasets have been collected over the years; INRIA [1], ETH [2], TUD-Brussels [3], Daimler [4] (Daimler stereo [5]), Caltech-USA [6], and KITTI [7] are the most commonly used ones. They all have different characteristics, weaknesses, and strengths.\nINRIA is amongst the oldest and as such has comparatively few images. It benefits however from high quality annotations of pedestrians in diverse settings (city, beach, mountains, etc.), which is why it is commonly selected for training (see also \u00a74.4). ETH and TUD-Brussels are mid-sized video datasets. Daimler is not considered by all methods because it lacks colour channels. Daimler stereo, ETH, and KITTI provide stereo information. All datasets but INRIA are obtained from video, and thus enable the use of optical flow as an additional cue.\nToday, Caltech-USA and KITTI are the predominant benchmarks for pedestrian detection. Both are comparatively large and challenging. Caltech-USA stands out for the large number of methods that have been evaluated side-byside. KITTI stands out because its test set is slightly more diverse, but is not yet used as frequently. For a more detailed discussion of the datasets please consult [8,7]. INRIA, ETH (monocular), TUD-Brussels, Daimler (monocular), and Caltech-USA are available under a unified evaluation toolbox; KITTI uses its own separate one with unpublished test data. Both toolboxes maintain an online ranking where published methods can be compared side by side.\nIn this paper we use primarily Caltech-USA for comparing methods, INRIA and KITTI secondarily. See figure 2 for example images. Caltech-USA and INRIA results are measured in log-average miss-rate (MR, lower is better), while KITTI uses area under the precision-recall curve (AUC, higher is better). Value of benchmarks Individual papers usually only show a narrow view over the state of the art on a dataset. Having an official benchmark that collects detections from all methods greatly eases the author\u2019s effort to put their curve into context, and provides reviewers easy access to the state of the art results. The collection of results enable retrospective analyses such as the one presented in the next section."

Instead of discussing the methods\u2019 individual particularities, we identify the key aspects that distinguish each method (ticks of table 1) and group them accordingly. We discuss these aspects in the next subsections.\nBrief chronology In 2003, Viola and Jones applied their VJ detector [44] to the task of pedestrian detection. In 2005 Dalal and Triggs introduced the landmark HOG [1] detector, which later served in 2008 as a building block for the now classic deformable part model DPM (named LatSvm here) by Felzenswalb et al. [12]. In 2009 the Caltech pedestrian detection benchmark was introduced, comparing seven pedestrian detectors [6]. At this point in time, the evaluation metrics changed from per-window (FPPW) to per-image (FPPI), once the flaws of the per-window evaluation were identified [8]. Under this new evalu-\nation metric some of the early detectors turned out to under-perform. About one third of the methods considered here were published during 2013, reflecting a renewed interest on the problem. Similarly, half of the KITTI results for pedestrian detection were submitted in 2014."

On table 1 we identify these families as DPM, DN, and DF respectively.\nBased on raw numbers alone boosted decision trees (DF) seem particularly suited for pedestrian detection, reaching top performance on both the \u201ctrain on INRIA, test on Caltech\u201d, and \u201ctrain on Caltech, test on Caltech\u201d tasks. It is unclear however what gives them an edge. The deep networks explored also show interesting properties and fast progress in detection quality. Conclusion Overall, at present, DPM variants, deep networks, and (boosted) decision forests all reach top performance in pedestrian detection (around 37% MR on Caltech-USA, see figure 3)."

This method obtains improvements when using the flawed FPPW evaluation metric (see section 3), but fails to perform well under the proper evaluation (FPPI). In the work on MultiFtrs [16], it was argued that, given enough features, Adaboost and linear SVM perform roughly the same for pedestrian detection.\nRecently, more and more components of the detector are optimized jointly with the \u201cdecision component\u201d (e.g. pooling regions in ChnFtrs [26], filters in JointDeep [40]). As a result the distinction between features and classifiers is not clear-cut anymore (see also sections 3.8 and 3.9). Conclusion There is no conclusive empirical evidence indicating that whether non-linear kernels provide meaningful gains over linear kernels (for pedestrian detection, when using non-trivial features). Similarly, it is unclear whether one particular type of classifier (e.g. SVM or decision forests) is better suited for pedestrian detection than another."

            "text": "The core problem of pedestrian detection focuses on individual monocular colour image frames. Some methods explore leveraging additional information at training and test time to improve detections. They consider stereo images [45], optical flow (using previous frames, e.g. MultiFtr+Motion [22] and ACF+SDt [42]), tracking [46], or data from other sensors (such as lidar [47] or radar).\nFor monocular methods it is still unclear how much tracking can improve per-frame detection itself. As seen in figure 4 exploiting optical flow provides a non-trivial improvement over the baselines. Curiously, the current best results (ACF-SDt [42]) are obtained using coarse rather than high quality flow. In section 4.2 we inspect the complementarity of flow with other ingredients. Good success exploiting flow and stereo on the Daimler dataset has been reported [48], but similar results have yet to be seen on newer datasets such as KITTI. Conclusion Using additional data provides meaningful improvements, albeit on modern dataset stereo and flow cues have yet to be fully exploited. As of now, methods based merely on single monocular image frames have been able to keep up with the performance improvement introduced by additional information."

Drawing on the context of the detection window, i.e. image content surrounding the window, can improve detection performance. Strategies for exploiting context include: ground plane constraints (MultiResC [33], RandForest [30]), variants of autocontext [49] (MOCO [36]), other cat-\negory detectors (MT-DPM+Context [39]), and person-to-person patterns (DBN\u2212Mut [34], +2Ped [35], JointDeep [40]).\nFigure 4 shows the performance improvement for methods incorporating context. Overall, we see improvements of 3 \u223c 7 MR percent points. (The negative impact of AFS+Geo is due to a change in evaluation, see section 3.) Interestingly, +2Ped [35] obtains a consistent 2 \u223c 5 MR percent point improvement over existing methods, even top performing ones (see section 4.2). Conclusion Context provides consistent improvements for pedestrian detection, although the scale of improvement is lower compared to additional test data (\u00a73.4) and deep architectures (\u00a73.8).

It is an idea that has become very popular and dozens of variants have been explored.\nFor pedestrian detection the results are competitive, but not salient (LatSvm [50,12], MultiResC [33], MT-DPM [39]). More interesting results have been obtained when modelling parts and their deformations inside a deep architecture (e.g. DBN\u2212Mut [34], JointDeep [40]).\nDPM and its variants are systematically outmatched by methods using a single component and no parts (Roerei [31], SquaresChnFtrs see section 4.1), casting doubt on the need for parts. Recent work has explored ways to capture deformations entirely without parts [51,52].\nConclusion For pedestrian detection there is still no clear evidence for the necessity of components and parts, beyond the case of occlusion handling."

It has recently been noticed that training different models for different resolutions systematically improve performance by 1 \u223c 2 MR percent points [33,31,39], since the detector has access to the full information available at each window size. This technique does not impact computational cost at detection time [53], although training time increases.\nConclusion Multi-scale models provide a simple and generic extension to existing detectors. Despite consistent improvements, their contribution to the final quality is rather minor."

            "text": "Large amounts of training data and increased computing power have lead to recent successes of deep architectures (typically convolutional neural networks) on diverse computer vision tasks (large scale classification and detection [54,55], semantic labelling [56]). These results have inspired the application of deep architectures to the pedestrian task.\nConvNet [13] uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised training to create a convolutional neural network trained on INRIA. This method obtains fair results on INRIA, ETH, and TUD-Brussels, however fails to generalise to the Caltech setup. This method learns to extract features directly from raw pixel values.\nAnother line of work focuses on using deep architectures to jointly model parts and occlusions (DBN\u2212Isol [28], DBN\u2212Mut [34], JointDeep [40], and SDN [41]). The performance improvement such integration varies between 1.5 to 14 MR percent points. Note that these works use edge and colour features [40,34,28], or initialise network weights to edge-sensitive filters, rather than discovering features from raw pixel values as usually done in deep architectures. No results have yet been reported using features pre-trained on ImageNet [54,57].\nConclusion Despite the common narrative there is still no clear evidence that deep networks are good at learning features for pedestrian detection (when using pedestrian detection training data). Most successful methods use such architectures to model higher level aspects of parts, occlusions, and context. The obtained results are on par with DPM and decision forest approaches, making the advantage of using such involved architectures yet unclear."

            "text": "The most popular approach (about 30% of the considered methods) for improving detection quality is to increase/diversify the features computed over the input image. By having richer and higher dimensional representations, the classification task becomes somewhat easier, enabling improved results. A large set of feature types have been explored: edge information [1,26,58,41], colour information [26,22], texture information [17], local shape information [38], covariance features [24], amongst others. More and more diverse features have been shown to systematically improve performance.\nWhile various decision forest methods use 10 feature channels (ChnFtrs, ACF, Roerei, SquaresChnFtrs, etc.), some papers have considered up to an order of magnitude more channels [16,58,24,30,38]. Despite the improvements by adding many channels, top performance is still reached with only 10 channels (6 gradient orientations, 1 gradient magnitude, and 3 colour channels, we name these HOG+LUV); see table 1 and figure 3. In section 4.1 we study in more detail different feature combinations.\nFrom all what we see, from VJ (95%MR) to ChnFtrs (56.34%MR, by adding HOG and LUV channels), to SquaresChnFtrs-Inria (50.17% MR, by exhaustive search over pooling sizes, see section 4), improved features drive progress. Switching training sets (section 3.1) enables SquaresChnFtrs-Caltech to reach state of the art performance on the Caltech-USA dataset; improving over significantly more sophisticated methods. InformedHaar [43] obtains top results by using a set of Haar-like features manually designed for the pedestrian detection task. In contrast SquaresChnFtrs-Caltech obtains similar results without using such hand-crafted features and being data driven instead.\nUpcoming studies show that using more (and better features) yields further improvements [59,60]. It should be noted that better features for pedestrian detection have not yet been obtained via deep learning approaches (see caveat on ImageNet features in section 3.8). Conclusion In the last decade improved features have been a constant driver for detection quality improvement, and it seems that it will remain so in the years to come. Most of this improvement has been obtained by extensive trial and error. The next scientific step will be to develop a more profound understanding of the what makes good features good, and how to design even better ones2."

We tune all methods on the INRIA test set, and demonstrate results on the Caltech-USA test set (see figure 5). Results on INRIA as well as implementation details can be found in the supplementary material.\nThe first series of experiments aims at mimicking landmark detection techniques, such as VJ [44], HOG+linear SVM [1], and ChnFtrs [26]. VJLike uses only the luminance colour channel, emulating the Haar wavelet like features from the original [44] using level 2 decision trees. HOGLike-L1/L2 use 8\u00d7 8 pixel pooling regions, 1 gradient magnitude and 6 oriented gradient channels, as well as level 1/2 decision trees. We also report results when adding the LUV colour channels HOGLike+LUV (10 feature channels total). SquaresChnFtrs is the baseline described in the beginning of section 4, which is similar to HOGLike+LUV to but with square pooling regions of any size.\nInspired by [60], we also expand the 10 HOG+LUV channels into 40 channels by convolving each channel with three DCT (discrete cosine transform) basis functions (of 7\u00d7 7 pixels), and storing the absolute value of the filter responses as additional feature channels. We name this variant SquaresChnFtrs+DCT.\nConclusion Much of the progress since VJ can by explained by the use of better features, based on oriented gradients and colour information. Simple tweaks to\nthese well known features (e.g. projection onto the DCT basis) can still yield noticeable improvements."

The context information is injected using the +2Ped re-weighting strategy [35] (the detection scores are combined with the scores of a \u201c2 person\u201d DPM detector). In all experiments both DCT and SDt features are pooled over 8\u00d7 8 regions (as in [33]), instead of \u201call square sizes\u201d for the HOG+LUV features.\nThe combination SquaresChnFtrs+DCT+SDt+2Ped is called Katamari-v1. Unsurprisingly, Katamari-v1 reaches the best known result on the Caltech-USA dataset. In figure 7 we show it together with the best performing method for each training set and solution family (see table 1). The supplementary material contains results of all combinations between the ingredients.\nConclusion Our experiments show that adding extra features, flow, and context information are largely complementary (12% gain, instead of 3+ 7+ 5%), even when starting from a strong detector. It remains to be seen if future progress in detection quality will be obtained by further insights of the \u201ccore\u201d algorithm (thus further diminishing the relative improvement of add-ons), or by extending the diversity of techniques employed inside a system."

            "text": "The main task of detection is to generalise from training to test set. Before we analyse the generalisation capability (section 4.4), we consider a necessary condition for high quality detection: is the learned model performing well on the training set?\nIn figure 6 we see the detection quality of the models considered in section 4.1, when evaluated over their training set. None of these methods performs perfectly on the training set. In fact, the trend is very similar to performance on the test set (see figure 5) and we do not observe yet symptoms of over-fitting. Conclusion Our results indicate that research on increasing the discriminative power of detectors is likely to further improve detection quality. More discriminative power can originate from more and better features or more complex classifiers.\n4.4 Generalisation across datasets\nTable 2: Effect of training set over the detection quality.

In that sense results of models trained on INRIA and tested on CaltechUSA are more relevant than the ones trained (and tested) on Caltech-USA.\nTable 2 shows the performance of SquaresChnFtrs over Caltech-USA when using different training sets (MR for INRIA/Caltech/ETH, AUC for KITTI). These experiments indicate that training on Caltech or KITTI provides little generalisation capability towards INRIA, while the converse is not true. Surprisingly, despite the visual similarity between KITTI and Caltech, INRIA is the second best training set choice for KITTI and Caltech. This shows that CaltechUSA pedestrians are of \u201ctheir own kind\u201d, and that the INRIA dataset is effective due to its diversity. In other words few diverse pedestrians (INRIA) is better than many similar ones (Caltech/KITTI).\nThe good news is that the best methods seem to perform well both across datasets and when trained on the respective training data. Figure 8 shows methods trained and tested on KITTI, we see that SquaresChnFtrs (named SquaresICF in KITTI) is better than vanilla DPM and on par with the best known DPM variant. The currently best method on KITTI, pAUC [59], is a variant of ChnFtrs using 250 feature channels (see the KITTI website for details on the methods). These two observations are consistent with our discussions in sections 3.9 and 4.1. Conclusion While detectors learned on one dataset may not necessarily transfer well to others, their ranking is stable across datasets, suggesting that insights can be learned from well-performing methods regardless of the benchmark."

Their combination produces best published detection performance on Caltech-USA.\nWhile the three big families of pedestrian detectors (deformable part models, decision forests, deep networks) are based on different learning techniques, their state-of-the-art results are surprisingly close.\nThe main challenge ahead seems to develop a deeper understanding of what makes good features good, so as to enable the design of even better ones."

We use 8 000 weak classifiers to compensate for the weak input feature, only square pooling regions, and level-2 trees to emulate the Haar wavelet-like features used by VJ. HOGLike-L1/L2 uses 8\u00d78 pixel pooling regions, 6 oriented gradients, 1 gradient magnitude, and level 1/2 decision trees (1/3 threshold comparisons respectively).
