Developing methods for the study and representation of emoji semantics helps to improve future multimodal communication systems. In this paper we explore the usage and semantics of emojis over time. We compare emoji embeddings trained on a corpus of different seasons and show that some emojis are used differently depending on the time of the year. Moreover, we propose a method to take into account the time information for emoji prediction systems, outperforming state-of-the-art systems. We show that, using the time information, the accuracy of some emojis can be significantly improved.",

In turn, they create a new form of multimodal communication, wherein images are used to enrich standard text messages. Over the past few years, the interest in emoji research has increased with several studies which contributed to emoji semantics [BRS16, ERA+16, WBSD17a, WBSD17b, BCC18], sentiment\nCopyright c\u00a9 2018 held by the author(s).

However, to the best of our knowledge, the temporal dimension of emojis has not been addressed in past research. In this paper we explore the temporal correlation between emoji usage and events during the year, and we show that temporal information helps disambiguate emoji meanings. For example, the four leaf clover emoji is usually associated with good luck wishes, while in March, the same emoji indicates parties and drinking, due to St. Patrick day. In addition, some emojis are naturally associated with specific seasons. (e.g., during Christmas and in Summer), or specific hours (e.g., by night, and in the morning). We show that considering temporal information helps predict emojis, including those that are not time-specific such as and ."

            "text": "Emoji semantics are difficult to analyze due to the subjective nature of emojis meanings, especially when it comes to describing emotions. Nevertheless, we study emoji semantic by association, i.e. we describe an emoji with either a set of semantically close emojis, or by emoji pair co-occurrence in the same tweet. To this extent, we train skip-gram word embeddings models [MSC+13] on the four different subsets (Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter) of our seasonal dataset. Each model embeds emojis within a high dimensional space (300 dimensions, 6 tokens window) where distance metrics translate to semantic closeness and cooccurrence. Following [BKRS16] we first evaluate emoji semantics by describing each emoji with its kNearest-Neighbours (k-NN) for each season. Secondly, for each model, we produce a correlation matrix that encodes the semantic correlation of pairs of emojis ap-\npearing in the same tweet. We then compare the four matrices to see if their correlation statistics is preserved across different seasons."

            "text": "For each season, emojis are associated to their k-NN, with k=10. We then look at the overlap of these NN for each emoji among different models. This way, we can investigate if a specific emoji shares the same set of NN across distinct seasons and thus if that emoji preserves its meaning across seasons. We also measure the number of NN that overlap in all the seasons to find emojis with smaller meaning variation during the year. Results are shown in Table 2. In the top half of the table, we notice that emojis related to music, animal, sweets, and emotions are not influenced by seasonality, i.e. they have the same set of Nearest-Neighbours in the four season-specific vector models (10-NN overlap \u2265 8).\nThe emojis for which their NN set varies the most across seasons are the ones listed in the bottom half of Table 2. Many are some sport-related emojis including and probably due to seasons of the year that are include more sports events that other periods. Also the emoji , used in a school/university graudation context, seems to change meaning across seasons. The Nearest-Neighbours of these emojis are party and heart-related emojis in Spring, while schoolrelated emojis in Autumn.\nAnother season-dependant example is the pine emoji (Table 3). The pine tree is associated with vegetation, camping and sunrise-related emoji in Spring and Summer, while in Autumn and Winter it co-occurs with Christmas-related emoji. The gift emoji present a similar behaviour: in Spring and Summer the three nearest neighbors are , and , while in Winter the three closest emojis are , , ."

To this extent, we compute for each season a 300\u00d7300 correlation matrix, where the correlation of emoji i and j is encoded as the cosine similarity between their 300-D feature vectors extracted from the season model. We then compare\npairs of seasons by evaluating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between their respective matrices. The most correlated matrices are Spring and Summer (0.871) while the lowest correlation is between Spring and Winter (0.837). However, all the matrices are highly correlated, suggesting that only a small subset of emojis have their semantic varying across seasons.\nTable 4 shows for each pair of seasons the pairs of emojis with the highest difference in similarity across those seasons. The differences between Spring and Summer (first column) does not look as significant as the differences between other seasons. We can spot few interesting cases. For example the pair is more correlated during Autumn and Winter than during Spring and Summer. This is due to a famous case of doping in sport occurred during that Autumn/Winter of 2016. The pair characterizes track related competitions happening during Spring and Summer. Another interesting case is the gift emoji that in Autumn and Winter relates to a Christmas gift, as it is highly correlated to and , while in Spring and Summer it is mostly used as a birthday gift as it is associated to emojis like and . The case of the pair can relate to either mass-shooting events or could simply suggests that in Autumn students have a hard time with the beginning of the new school year. One of the emojis that seems to be used differently in Autumn and Winter is the Skull , likely due to the usage of this emoji during Halloween time."

We use the attention mechanism introduced in [YYD+16], which can be considered as a weighted average of the output of the Word LSTM, where the weights are learned during training.

In this way, we can learn vectors of each month, day of the week and hour, using them for the final classification. These vectors are concatenated all together and incorporated in two different ways in the base system: at an early stage or at late stage. The early stage consists in concatenating this date embeddings to the word representation (char+word embeddings) and pass them to the Word LSTM. The late incorporation consists in concatenating the date embeddings with the output vector of the word attention and make the final predictions. We only use one of the methods to include date without combining them."

Coverage error (CE) is defined as the average number of labels that have to be in-\ncluded in the final prediction such that all true labels are predicted.\nFrom the results we can see that the best system is the model with early incorporation of the date as it outperforms all the other models. The late date method is the worst system, even if it seems to create better prediction distributions than the without date system, since the CE is lower. In Table 6 we report the emojis with higher gain in F1, from without date and early date, to understand the emojis that depend most on the time information. Among all of the emojis we can see emojis that clearly depend on the month (St. Patrick day, Summer) or the hour (sunrise, moon)."

Moreover, we proposed a method to take in account the date information for emoji prediction systems, slightly improving the state-of-the-art. We show that, using the date information, the accuracy of some emojis can be improved. Some of them are clearly time dependent (e.g., , ). Others are not directly associated to time but time information helps to predict them ( , , and ).\nIn the future we plan to study the semantics of emojis over the day (morning/night) or over the week (weekdays/weekend) and improve the date information modules, trying the two methods we proposed together (early+late)."
