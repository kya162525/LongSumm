    "abstractText": "We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

            "text": "Stochastic gradient-based optimization is of core practical importance in many fields of science and engineering. Many problems in these fields can be cast as the optimization of some scalar parameterized objective function requiring maximization or minimization with respect to its parameters. If the function is differentiable w.r.t. its parameters, gradient descent is a relatively efficient optimization method, since the computation of first-order partial derivatives w.r.t. all the parameters is of the same computational complexity as just evaluating the function. Often, objective functions are stochastic. For example, many objective functions are composed of a sum of subfunctions evaluated at different subsamples of data; in this case optimization can be made more efficient by taking gradient steps w.r.t. individual subfunctions, i.e. stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or ascent. SGD proved itself as an efficient and effective optimization method that was central in many machine learning success stories, such as recent advances in deep learning (Deng et al., 2013; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006; Hinton et al., 2012a; Graves et al., 2013). Objectives may also have other sources of noise than data subsampling, such as dropout (Hinton et al., 2012b) regularization. For all such noisy objectives, efficient stochastic optimization techniques are required. The focus of this paper is on the optimization of stochastic objectives with high-dimensional parameters spaces. In these cases, higher-order optimization methods are ill-suited, and discussion in this paper will be restricted to first-order methods.\nWe propose Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization that only requires first-order gradients with little memory requirement. The method computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients; the name Adam is derived from adaptive moment estimation. Our method is designed to combine the advantages of two recently popular methods: AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), which works well with sparse gradients, and RMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012), which works well in on-line and non-stationary settings; important connections to these and other stochastic optimization methods are clarified in section 5. Some of Adam\u2019s advantages are that the magnitudes of parameter updates are invariant to rescaling of the gradient, its stepsizes are approximately bounded by the stepsize hyperparameter, it does not require a stationary objective, it works with sparse gradients, and it naturally performs a form of step size annealing.\n\u2217Equal contribution.

Section 3 explains our initialization bias correction technique, and section 4 provides a theoretical analysis of Adam\u2019s convergence in online convex programming. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms other methods for a variety of models and datasets, as shown in section 6. Overall, we show that Adam is a versatile algorithm that scales to large-scale high-dimensional machine learning problems."

Let f(\u03b8) be a noisy objective function: a stochastic scalar function that is differentiable w.r.t. parameters \u03b8. We are interested in minimizing the expected value of this function, E[f(\u03b8)] w.r.t. its parameters \u03b8. With f1(\u03b8), ..., , fT (\u03b8) we denote the realisations of the stochastic function at subsequent timesteps 1, ..., T . The stochasticity might come from the evaluation at random subsamples (minibatches) of datapoints, or arise from inherent function noise. With gt = \u2207\u03b8ft(\u03b8) we denote the gradient, i.e. the vector of partial derivatives of ft, w.r.t \u03b8 evaluated at timestep t.\nThe algorithm updates exponential moving averages of the gradient (mt) and the squared gradient (vt) where the hyper-parameters \u03b21, \u03b22 \u2208 [0, 1) control the exponential decay rates of these moving averages. The moving averages themselves are estimates of the 1st moment (the mean) and the 2nd raw moment (the uncentered variance) of the gradient. However, these moving averages are initialized as (vectors of) 0\u2019s, leading to moment estimates that are biased towards zero, especially during the initial timesteps, and especially when the decay rates are small (i.e. the \u03b2s are close to 1). The good news is that this initialization bias can be easily counteracted, resulting in bias-corrected estimates m\u0302t and v\u0302t. See section 3 for more details.\nNote that the efficiency of algorithm 1 can, at the expense of clarity, be improved upon by changing the order of computation, e.g. by replacing the last three lines in the loop with the following lines: \u03b1t = \u03b1 \u00b7 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b2t2/(1\u2212 \u03b2t1) and \u03b8t \u2190 \u03b8t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1t \u00b7mt/( \u221a vt + \u0302)."

Assuming = 0, the effective step taken in parameter space at timestep t is \u2206t = \u03b1 \u00b7 m\u0302t/ \u221a v\u0302t. The effective stepsize has\ntwo upper bounds: |\u2206t| \u2264 \u03b1 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 \u03b21)/ \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b22 in the case (1 \u2212 \u03b21) > \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b22, and |\u2206t| \u2264 \u03b1\notherwise. The first case only happens in the most severe case of sparsity: when a gradient has been zero at all timesteps except at the current timestep. For less sparse cases, the effective stepsize will be smaller. When (1 \u2212 \u03b21) = \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b22 we have that |m\u0302t/ \u221a v\u0302t| < 1 therefore |\u2206t| < \u03b1. In\nmore common scenarios, we will have that m\u0302t/ \u221a v\u0302t \u2248 \u00b11 since |E[g]/ \u221a E[g2]| \u2264 1. The effective magnitude of the steps taken in parameter space at each timestep are approximately bounded by the stepsize setting \u03b1, i.e., |\u2206t| / \u03b1. This can be understood as establishing a trust region around the current parameter value, beyond which the current gradient estimate does not provide sufficient information. This typically makes it relatively easy to know the right scale of \u03b1 in advance. For many machine learning models, for instance, we often know in advance that good optima are with high probability within some set region in parameter space; it is not uncommon, for example, to have a prior distribution over the parameters. Since \u03b1 sets (an upper bound of) the magnitude of steps in parameter space, we can often deduce the right order of magnitude of \u03b1 such that optima can be reached from \u03b80 within some number of iterations. With a slight abuse of terminology, we will call the ratio m\u0302t/ \u221a v\u0302t the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). With a smaller SNR the effective stepsize \u2206t will be closer to zero. This is a desirable property, since a smaller SNR means that there is greater uncertainty about whether the direction of m\u0302t corresponds to the direction of the true gradient. For example, the SNR value typically becomes closer to 0 towards an optimum, leading to smaller effective steps in parameter space: a form of automatic annealing. The effective stepsize \u2206t is also invariant to the scale of the gradients; rescaling the gradients g with factor c will scale m\u0302t with a factor c and v\u0302t with a factor c2, which cancel out: (c \u00b7 m\u0302t)/( \u221a c2 \u00b7 v\u0302t) = m\u0302t/ \u221a v\u0302t."

We will here derive the term for the second moment estimate; the derivation for the first moment estimate is completely analogous.

Let g1, ..., gT be the gradients at subsequent timesteps, each a draw from an underlying gradient distribution gt \u223c p(gt). Let us initialize the exponential moving average as v0 = 0 (a vector of zeros). First note that the update at timestep t of the exponential moving average vt = \u03b22 \u00b7 vt\u22121 + (1\u2212 \u03b22) \u00b7 g2t (where g2t indicates the elementwise square gt gt) can be written as a function of the gradients at all previous timesteps:\nvt = (1\u2212 \u03b22) t\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2t\u2212i2 \u00b7 g2i (1)\nWe wish to know how E[vt], the expected value of the exponential moving average at timestep t, relates to the true second moment E[g2t ], so we can correct for the discrepancy between the two.

What is left is the term (1 \u2212 \u03b2t2) which is caused by initializing the running average with zeros. In algorithm 1 we therefore divide by this term to correct the initialization bias.\nIn case of sparse gradients, for a reliable estimate of the second moment one needs to average over many gradients by chosing a small value of \u03b22; however it is exactly this case of small \u03b22 where a lack of initialisation bias correction would lead to initial steps that are much larger."

Given an arbitrary, unknown sequence of convex cost functions f1(\u03b8), f2(\u03b8),..., fT (\u03b8). At each time t, our goal is to predict the parameter \u03b8t and evaluate it on a previously unknown cost function ft. Since the nature of the sequence is unknown in advance, we evaluate our algorithm using the regret, that is the sum of all the previous difference between the online prediction ft(\u03b8t) and the best fixed point parameter ft(\u03b8\u2217) from a feasible set X for all the previous steps. Concretely, the regret is defined as:\nR(T ) =\nT\u2211\nt=1\n[ft(\u03b8t)\u2212 ft(\u03b8\u2217)] (5)\nwhere \u03b8\u2217 = arg min\u03b8\u2208X \u2211T t=1 ft(\u03b8).

Other stochastic optimization methods include vSGD (Schaul et al., 2012), AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012) and the natural Newton method from Roux & Fitzgibbon (2010), all setting stepsizes by estimating curvature\nfrom first-order information. The Sum-of-Functions Optimizer (SFO) (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2014) is a quasi-Newton method based on minibatches, but (unlike Adam) has memory requirements linear in the number of minibatch partitions of a dataset, which is often infeasible on memory-constrained systems such as a GPU. Like natural gradient descent (NGD) (Amari, 1998), Adam employs a preconditioner that adapts to the geometry of the data, since v\u0302t is an approximation to the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix (Pascanu & Bengio, 2013); however, Adam\u2019s preconditioner (like AdaGrad\u2019s) is more conservative in its adaption than vanilla NGD by preconditioning with the square root of the inverse of the diagonal Fisher information matrix approximation.\nRMSProp: An optimization method closely related to Adam is RMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012). A version with momentum has sometimes been used (Graves, 2013). There are a few important differences between RMSProp with momentum and Adam: RMSProp with momentum generates its parameter updates using a momentum on the rescaled gradient, whereas Adam updates are directly estimated using a running average of first and second moment of the gradient. RMSProp also lacks a bias-correction term; this matters most in case of a value of \u03b22 close to 1 (required in case of sparse gradients), since in that case not correcting the bias leads to very large stepsizes and often divergence, as we also empirically demonstrate in section 6.4.\nAdaGrad: An algorithm that works well for sparse gradients is AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011). Its basic version updates parameters as \u03b8t+1 = \u03b8t \u2212\u03b1 \u00b7 gt/ \u221a\u2211t i=1 g 2 t . Note that if we choose \u03b22 to be infinitesimally close to 1 from below, then lim\u03b22\u21921 v\u0302t = t \u22121 \u00b7\u2211ti=1 g2t . AdaGrad corresponds to a version of Adam with \u03b21 = 0, infinitesimal (1\u2212 \u03b22) and a replacement of \u03b1 by an annealed version \u03b1t = \u03b1 \u00b7 t\u22121/2, namely \u03b8t \u2212 \u03b1 \u00b7 t\u22121/2 \u00b7 m\u0302t/ \u221a lim\u03b22\u21921 v\u0302t = \u03b8t \u2212 \u03b1 \u00b7 t\u22121/2 \u00b7 gt/ \u221a t\u22121 \u00b7\u2211ti=1 g2t = \u03b8t \u2212 \u03b1 \u00b7 gt/ \u221a\u2211t i=1 g 2 t . Note that this direct correspondence between Adam and Adagrad does not hold when removing the bias-correction terms; without bias correction, like in RMSProp, a \u03b22 infinitesimally close to 1 would lead to infinitely large bias, and infinitely large parameter updates."

The logistic regression classifies the class label directly on the 784 dimension image vectors. We compare Adam to accelerated SGD with Nesterov momentum and Adagrad using minibatch size of 128. According to Figure 1, we found that the Adam yields similar convergence as SGD with momentum and both converge faster than Adagrad.\nAs discussed in (Duchi et al., 2011), Adagrad can efficiently deal with sparse features and gradients as one of its main theoretical results whereas SGD is low at learning rare features. Adam with 1/ \u221a t decay on its stepsize should theoratically match the performance of Adagrad. We examine the sparse feature problem using IMDB movie review dataset from (Maas et al., 2011). We pre-process the IMDB movie reviews into bag-of-words (BoW) feature vectors including the first 10,000 most frequent words. The 10,000 dimension BoW feature vector for each review is highly sparse. As suggested in (Wang & Manning, 2013), 50% dropout noise can be applied to the BoW features during\ntraining to prevent over-fitting. In figure 1, Adagrad outperforms SGD with Nesterov momentum by a large margin both with and without dropout noise. Adam converges as fast as Adagrad. The empirical performance of Adam is consistent with our theoretical findings in sections 2 and 4. Similar to Adagrad, Adam can take advantage of sparse features and obtain faster convergence rate than normal SGD with momentum."

We used their implementation and compared with Adam to train such models. Figure 2 shows that Adam makes faster progress in terms of both the number of iterations and wall-clock time. Due to the cost of updating curvature information, SFO is 5-10x slower per iteration compared to Adam, and has a memory requirement that is linear in the number minibatches.\nStochastic regularization methods, such as dropout, are an effective way to prevent over-fitting and often used in practice due to their simplicity. SFO assumes deterministic subfunctions, and indeed failed to converge on cost functions with stochastic regularization.

Our CNN architecture has three alternating stages of 5x5 convolution filters and 3x3 max pooling with stride of 2 that are followed by a fully connected layer of 1000 rectified linear hidden units (ReLU\u2019s). The input image are pre-processed by whitening, and\ndropout noise is applied to the input layer and fully connected layer.

We notice the second moment estimate v\u0302t vanishes to zeros after a few epochs and is dominated by the in algorithm 1. The second moment estimate is therefore a poor approximation to the geometry of the cost function in CNNs comparing to fully connected network from Section 6.2.

Note that, conveniently enough, we don\u2019t need to correct for initialization bias in this case. Also note that the magnitude of parameter updates has a simpler bound with AdaMax than Adam, namely: |\u2206t| \u2264 \u03b1."

            "text": "Since the last iterate is noisy due to stochastic approximation, better generalization performance is often achieved by averaging. Previously in Moulines & Bach (2011), Polyak-Ruppert averaging (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992; Ruppert, 1988) has been shown to improve the convergence of standard SGD, where \u03b8\u0304t = 1t \u2211n k=1 \u03b8k. Alternatively, an exponential moving average over the parameters can be used, giving higher weight to more recent parameter values. This can be trivially implemented by adding one line to the inner loop of algorithms 1 and 2: \u03b8\u0304t \u2190 \u03b22 \u00b7 \u03b8\u0304t\u22121 +(1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b8t, with \u03b8\u03040 = 0. Initalization bias can again be corrected by the estimator \u03b8\u0302t = \u03b8\u0304t/(1\u2212 \u03b2t2)."

            "text": "We have introduced a simple and computationally efficient algorithm for gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions. Our method is aimed towards machine learning problems with\nlarge datasets and/or high-dimensional parameter spaces. The method combines the advantages of two recently popular optimization methods: the ability of AdaGrad to deal with sparse gradients, and the ability of RMSProp to deal with non-stationary objectives. The method is straightforward to implement and requires little memory. The experiments confirm the analysis on the rate of convergence in convex problems. Overall, we found Adam to be robust and well-suited to a wide range of non-convex optimization problems in the field machine learning."
