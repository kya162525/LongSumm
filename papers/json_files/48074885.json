            "text": "Text classification is an important task in Natural Language Processing with many applications, such as web search, information retrieval, ranking and document classification (Deerwester et al., 1990; Pang and Lee, 2008). Recently, models based on neural networks have become increasingly popular (Kim, 2014; Zhang and LeCun, 2015; Conneau et al., 2016). While these models achieve very good performance in practice, they tend to be relatively slow both at train and test time, limiting their use on very large datasets.\nMeanwhile, linear classifiers are often considered as strong baselines for text classification problems (Joachims, 1998; McCallum and Nigam, 1998; Fan et al., 2008). Despite their simplicity, they often obtain stateof-the-art performances if the right features are used (Wang and Manning, 2012). They also have the potential to scale to very large corpus (Agarwal et al., 2014).\nIn this work, we explore ways to scale these baselines to very large corpus with a large output space, in the context of text classification. Inspired by the recent work in efficient word representation learning (Mikolov et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2015), we show that linear models with a rank constraint and a fast loss approximation can train on a billion words within ten minutes, while achieving performance on par with the state-of-the-art. We evaluate the quality of our approachfastText1 on two different tasks, namely tag prediction and sentiment analysis."

However, linear classifiers do not share parameters among features and classes. This possibly limits their generalization in the context of large output space where some classes have very few examples. Common solutions to this problem are to factorize the linear classifier into low rank matrices (Schutze, 1992; Mikolov et al., 2013) or to use multilayer neural networks (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Zhang et al., 2015).\nFigure 1 shows a simple linear model with rank constraint. The first weight matrixA is a look-up table over the words. The word representations are then averaged into a text representation, which is in turn fed to a linear classifier. The text representa-\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText\ntion is an hidden variable which can be potentially be reused. This architecture is similar to the cbow model of Mikolov et al. (2013), where the middle word is replaced by a label. We use the softmax function f to compute the probability distribution over the predefined classes. For a set ofN documents, this leads to minimizing the negative loglikelihood over the classes:\n\u2212 1\nN\nN\u2211\nn=1\nyn log(f(BAxn)),\nwherexn is the normalized bag of features of thenth document,yn the label,A andB the weight matrices.

            "text": "When the number of classes is large, computing the linear classifier is computationally expensive. More precisely, the computational complexity isO(kh) where k is the number of classes andh the dimension of the text representation. In order to improve our running time, we use a hierarchical softmax (Goodman, 2001) based on the Huffman coding tree (Mikolov et al., 2013). During training, the computational complexity drops toO(h log2(k)).\nThe hierarchical softmax is also advantageous at test time when searching for the most likely class. Each node is associated with a probability that is the probability of the path from the root to that node. If the node is at depthl+1 with parentsn1, . . . , nl, its probability is\nP (nl+1) = l\u220f\ni=1\nP (ni).\nThis means that the probability of a node is always lower than the one of its parent. Exploring the tree with a depth first search and tracking the maximum probability among the leaves allows us to discard any branch associated with a small probability. In practice, we observe a reduction of the complexity to O(h log2(k)) at test time. This approach is further extended to compute theT -top targets at the cost ofO(log(T )), using a binary heap."

Instead, we use a bag of n-grams as additional features to capture some partial information about the local word order. This is very efficient in practice while achieving comparable results to methods that explicitly use the order (Wang and Manning, 2012).\nWe maintain a fast and memory efficient mapping of the n-grams by using thehashing trick (Weinberger et al., 2009) with the same hashing function as in Mikolov et al. (2011) and 10M bins if we only used bigrams, and 100M otherwise."

Note that we can increase the accuracy slightly by using more n-grams, for example with trigrams, the performance on Sogou goes up to 97.1%. Finally, Figure 3 shows that our method is competitive with the methods presented in Tang et al. (2015). We tune the hyperparameters on the validation set and observe that using n-grams up to 5 leads to the best performance. Unlike Tang et al.

Both models achieve a similar performance with a small hidden layer, but adding bigrams gives us a significant boost in accuracy. At test time, Tagspace needs to compute the scores for all the classes which makes it relatively slow, while our fast inference gives a significant speed-up when the number of classes is large (more than 300K here). Overall, we are more than an order of magitude faster to obtain model with a better quality. The speedup of the test phase is even more significant (a 600\u00d7 speedup).
