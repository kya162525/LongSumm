    "abstractText": "We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either. Many problems in image processing, computer graphics, and computer vision can be posed as \u201ctranslating\u201d an input image into a corresponding output image. Just as a concept may be expressed in either English or French, a scene may be rendered as an RGB image, a gradient field, an edge map, a semantic label map, etc. In analogy to automatic language translation, we define automatic image-to-image translation as the problem of translating one possible representation of a scene into another, given sufficient training data (see Figure 1). One reason language translation is difficult is because the mapping between languages is rarely one-to-one \u2013 any given concept is easier to express in one language than another. Similarly, most image-to-image translation problems are either many-to-one (computer vision) \u2013 mapping photographs to edges, segments, or semantic labels, or one-to-many (computer graphics) \u2013 mapping labels or sparse user inputs to realistic images. Traditionally, each of these tasks has been tackled with separate, special-purpose machinery (e.g., [7, 15, 11, 1, 3, 37, 21, 26, 9, 42, 46]), despite the fact that the setting is always the same: predict pixels from pixels. Our goal in this paper is to develop a common framework for all these problems. 1 ar X iv :1 61 1. 07 00 4v 1 [ cs .C V ] 2 1 N ov 2 01 6 The community has already taken significant steps in this direction, with convolutional neural nets (CNNs) becoming the common workhorse behind a wide variety of image prediction problems. CNNs learn to minimize a loss function \u2013 an objective that scores the quality of results \u2013 and although the learning process is automatic, a lot of manual effort still goes into designing effective losses. In other words, we still have to tell the CNN what we wish it to minimize. But, just like Midas, we must be careful what we wish for! If we take a naive approach, and ask the CNN to minimize Euclidean distance between predicted and ground truth pixels, it will tend to produce blurry results [29, 46]. This is because Euclidean distance is minimized by averaging all plausible outputs, which causes blurring. Coming up with loss functions that force the CNN to do what we really want \u2013 e.g., output sharp, realistic images \u2013 is an open problem and generally requires expert knowledge. It would be highly desirable if we could instead specify only a high-level goal, like \u201cmake the output indistinguishable from reality\u201d, and then automatically learn a loss function appropriate for satisfying this goal. Fortunately, this is exactly what is done by the recently proposed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [14, 5, 30, 36, 47]. GANs learn a loss that tries to classify if the output image is real or fake, while simultaneously training a generative model to minimize this loss. Blurry images will not be tolerated since they look obviously fake. Because GANs learn a loss that adapts to the data, they can be applied to a multitude of tasks that traditionally would require very different kinds of loss functions. In this paper, we explore GANs in the conditional setting. Just as GANs learn a generative model of data, conditional GANs (cGANs) learn a conditional generative model [14]. This makes cGANs suitable for image-to-image translation tasks, where we condition on an input image and generate a corresponding output image. GANs have been vigorously studied in the last two years and many of the techniques we explore in this paper have been previously proposed. Nonetheless, earlier papers have focused on specific applications, and it has remained unclear how effective image-conditional GANs can be as a general-purpose solution for image-toimage translation. Our primary contribution is to demonstrate that on a wide variety of problems, conditional GANs produce reasonable results. Our second contribution is to present a simple framework sufficient to achieve good results, and to analyze the effects of several important architectural choices.

            "text": "We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.\nMany problems in image processing, computer graphics, and computer vision can be posed as \u201ctranslating\u201d an input image into a corresponding output image. Just as a concept\nmay be expressed in either English or French, a scene may be rendered as an RGB image, a gradient field, an edge map, a semantic label map, etc. In analogy to automatic language translation, we define automatic image-to-image translation as the problem of translating one possible representation of a scene into another, given sufficient training data (see Figure 1). One reason language translation is difficult is because the mapping between languages is rarely one-to-one \u2013 any given concept is easier to express in one language than another. Similarly, most image-to-image translation problems are either many-to-one (computer vision) \u2013 mapping photographs to edges, segments, or semantic labels, or one-to-many (computer graphics) \u2013 mapping labels or sparse user inputs to realistic images. Traditionally, each of these tasks has been tackled with separate, special-purpose machinery (e.g., [7, 15, 11, 1, 3, 37, 21, 26, 9, 42, 46]), despite the fact that the setting is always the same: predict pixels from pixels. Our goal in this paper is to develop a common framework for all these problems.\n1\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\nThe community has already taken significant steps in this direction, with convolutional neural nets (CNNs) becoming the common workhorse behind a wide variety of image prediction problems. CNNs learn to minimize a loss function \u2013 an objective that scores the quality of results \u2013 and although the learning process is automatic, a lot of manual effort still goes into designing effective losses. In other words, we still have to tell the CNN what we wish it to minimize. But, just like Midas, we must be careful what we wish for! If we take a naive approach, and ask the CNN to minimize Euclidean distance between predicted and ground truth pixels, it will tend to produce blurry results [29, 46]. This is because Euclidean distance is minimized by averaging all plausible outputs, which causes blurring. Coming up with loss functions that force the CNN to do what we really want \u2013 e.g., output sharp, realistic images \u2013 is an open problem and generally requires expert knowledge.\nIt would be highly desirable if we could instead specify only a high-level goal, like \u201cmake the output indistinguishable from reality\u201d, and then automatically learn a loss function appropriate for satisfying this goal. Fortunately, this is exactly what is done by the recently proposed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [14, 5, 30, 36, 47]. GANs learn a loss that tries to classify if the output image is real or fake, while simultaneously training a generative model to minimize this loss. Blurry images will not be tolerated since they look obviously fake. Because GANs learn a loss that adapts to the data, they can be applied to a multitude of tasks that traditionally would require very different kinds of loss functions.\nIn this paper, we explore GANs in the conditional setting. Just as GANs learn a generative model of data, conditional GANs (cGANs) learn a conditional generative model [14]. This makes cGANs suitable for image-to-image translation tasks, where we condition on an input image and generate a corresponding output image.\nGANs have been vigorously studied in the last two years and many of the techniques we explore in this paper have been previously proposed. Nonetheless, earlier papers have focused on specific applications, and it has remained unclear how effective image-conditional GANs can be as a general-purpose solution for image-toimage translation. Our primary contribution is to demonstrate that on a wide variety of problems, conditional GANs produce reasonable results. Our second contribution is to present a simple framework sufficient to achieve good results, and to analyze the effects of several important architectural choices.

These formulations treat the output space as \u201cunstructured\u201d in the sense that each output pixel is considered conditionally independent from all others given the input image. Conditional GANs instead learn a structured loss. Structured losses penalize the joint configuration of the output. A large body of literature has considered losses of this kind, with popular methods including conditional random fields [2], the SSIM metric [40], feature matching [6], nonparametric losses [24], the convolutional pseudo-prior [41], and losses based on matching covariance statistics [19]. Our conditional GAN is different in that the loss is learned, and can, in theory, penalize any possible structure that differs between output and target.\nConditional GANs We are not the first to apply GANs in the conditional setting. Previous works have conditioned GANs on discrete labels [28], text [32], and, indeed, images. The image-conditional models have tackled inpainting [29], image prediction from a normal map [39], image manipulation guided by user constraints [49], future frame prediction [27], future state prediction [48], product photo generation [43], and style transfer [25]. Each of these methods was tailored for a specific application. Our framework differs in that nothing is application-specific. This makes our setup considerably simpler than most others.\nOur method also differs from these prior works in several architectural choices for the generator and discriminator. Unlike past work, for our generator we use a \u201cU-Net\u201dbased architecture [34], and for our discriminator we use a convolutional \u201cPatchGAN\u201d classifier, which only penalizes structure at the scale of image patches. A similar PatchGAN architecture was previously proposed in [25], for the purpose of capturing local style statistics. Here we show that this approach is effective on a wider range of problems, and we investigate the effect of changing the patch size."

The discriminator\u2019s job remains unchanged, but the generator is tasked to not only fool the discriminator but also to be near the ground truth output in an L2 sense. We also explore this option, using L1 distance rather than L2 as L1 encourages less blurring:\nLL1(G) = Ex,y\u223cpdata(x,y),z\u223cpz(z)[\u2016y \u2212G(x, z)\u20161].

(4)\nWithout z, the net could still learn a mapping from x to y, but would produce deterministic outputs, and therefore fail to match any distribution other than a delta function. Past conditional GANs have acknowledged this and provided Gaussian noise z as an input to the generator, in addition to x (e.g., [39]). In initial experiments, we did not find\nthis strategy effective \u2013 the generator simply learned to ignore the noise \u2013 which is consistent with Mathieu et al. [27]. Instead, for our final models, we provide noise only in the form of dropout, applied on several layers of our generator at both training and test time. Despite the dropout noise, we observe very minor stochasticity in the output of our nets. Designing conditional GANs that produce stochastic output, and thereby capture the full entropy of the conditional distributions they model, is an important question left open by the present work."

In addition, for the problems we consider, the input and output differ in surface appearance, but both are renderings of the same underlying structure. Therefore, structure in the input is roughly aligned with structure in the output. We design the generator architecture around these considerations.\nMany previous solutions [29, 39, 19, 48, 43] to problems in this area have used an encoder-decoder network [16]. In such a network, the input is passed through a series of layers that progressively downsample, until a bottleneck layer, at which point the process is reversed (Figure 3). Such a network requires that all information flow pass through all the layers, including the bottleneck. For many image translation problems, there is a great deal of low-level information shared between the input and output, and it would be\ndesirable to shuttle this information directly across the net. For example, in the case of image colorizaton, the input and output share the location of prominent edges.\nTo give the generator a means to circumvent the bottleneck for information like this, we add skip connections, following the general shape of a \u201cU-Net\u201d [34] (Figure 3). Specifically, we add skip connections between each layer i and layer n\u2212 i, where n is the total number of layers. Each skip connection simply concatenates all channels at layer i with those at layer n\u2212 i."

Although these losses fail to encourage highfrequency crispness, in many cases they nonetheless accurately capture the low frequencies. For problems where this is the case, we do not need an entirely new framework to enforce correctness at the low frequencies. L1 will already do.\nThis motivates restricting the GAN discriminator to only model high-frequency structure, relying on an L1 term to force low-frequency correctness (Eqn. 4). In order to model high-frequencies, it is sufficient to restrict our attention to the structure in local image patches. Therefore, we design a discriminator architecture \u2013 which we term a PatchGAN \u2013 that only penalizes structure at the scale of patches. This discriminator tries to classify if each N \u00d7 N patch in an image is real or fake. We run this discriminator convolutationally across the image, averaging all responses to provide the ultimate output of D.\nIn Section 3.4, we demonstrate that N can be much smaller than the full size of the image and still produce high quality results. This is advantageous because a smaller PatchGAN has fewer parameters, runs faster, and can be applied on arbitrarily large images.\nSuch a discriminator effectively models the image as a Markov random field, assuming independence between pixels separated by more than a patch diameter. This connection was previously explored in [25], and is also the common assumption in models of texture [8, 12] and style [7, 15, 13, 24]. Our PatchGAN can therefore be understood as a form of texture/style loss."

This differs from the usual protocol in that we apply dropout at test time,\nand we apply batch normalization [18] using the statistics of the test batch, rather than aggregated statistics of the training batch. This approach to batch normalization, when the batch size is set to 1, has been termed \u201cinstance normalization\u201d and has been demonstrated to be effective at image generation tasks [38]. In our experiments, we use batch size 1 for certain experiments and 4 for others, noting little difference between these two conditions."

Traditional metrics such as perpixel mean-squared error do not assess joint statistics of the result, and therefore do not measure the very structure that structured losses aim to capture.\nIn order to more holistically evaluate the visual quality of our results, we employ two tactics. First, we run\n\u201creal vs fake\u201d perceptual studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). For graphics problems like colorization and photo generation, plausibility to a human observer is often the ultimate goal. Therefore, we test our map generation, aerial photo generation, and image colorization using this approach.\nSecond, we measure whether or not our synthesized cityscapes are realistic enough that off-the-shelf recognition system can recognize the objects in them. This metric is similar to the \u201cinception score\u201d from [36], the object detection evaluation in [39], and the \u201csemantic interpretability\u201d measure in [46].\nAMT perceptual studies For our AMT experiments, we followed the protocol from [46]: Turkers were presented with a series of trials that pitted a \u201creal\u201d image against a \u201cfake\u201d image generated by our algorithm. On each trial, each image appeared for 1 second, after which the images disappeared and Turkers were given unlimited time to respond as to which was fake. The first 10 images of each session were practice and Turkers were given feedback. No feedback was provided on the 40 trials of the main experiment. Each session tested just one algorithm at a time, and Turkers were not allowed to complete more than one session. \u223c 50 Turkers evaluated each algorithm. All images were presented at 256 \u00d7 256 resolution. Unlike [46], we did not include vigilance trials. For our colorization experiments, the real and fake images were generated from the same grayscale input. For map\u2194aerial photo, the real and fake images were not generated from the same input, in order to make the task more difficult and avoid floor-level results.\nFCN-score While quantitative evaluation of generative models is known to be challenging, recent works [36, 39, 46] have tried using pre-trained semantic classifiers to measure the discriminability of the generated images as a pseudo-metric. The intuition is that if the generated images are realistic, classifiers trained on real images will be able to classify the synthesized image correctly as well. To this end, we adopt the popular FCN-8s [26] architecture for semantic segmentation, and train it on the cityscapes dataset. We then score synthesized photos by the classification accuracy against the labels these photos were synthesized from."

We run ablation studies to isolate the effect of the L1 term, the GAN term, and to compare using a discriminator conditioned on the input (cGAN, Eqn. 1) against using an unconditional discriminator (GAN, Eqn. 2).\nFigure 4 shows the qualitative effects of these variations on two labels\u2192photo problems. L1 alone leads to reasonable but blurry results. The cGAN alone (setting \u03bb = 0 in Eqn. 4) gives much sharper results, but results in some artifacts in facade synthesis. Adding both terms together (with \u03bb = 100) reduces these artifacts.\nWe quantify these observations using the FCN-score on the cityscapes labels\u2192photo task (Table 1): the GAN-based objectives achieve higher scores, indicating that the synthesized images include more recognizable structure. We also test the effect of removing conditioning from the discriminator (labeled as GAN). In this case, the loss does not penalize mismatch between the input and output; it only cares that the output look realistic. This variant results in very poor performance; examining the results reveals that the generator collapsed into producing nearly the exact same output regardless of input photograph. Clearly it is important, in this case, that the loss measure the quality of the match between input and output, and indeed cGAN performs much better than GAN. Note, however, that adding an L1 term also encourages that the output respect the input, since the L1 loss penalizes the distance between ground truth outputs, which match the input, and synthesized outputs, which may not. Correspondingly, L1+GAN is also effective at creating realistic renderings that respect the in-\nL1 1x1 16x16 70x70 256x256\nFigure 6: Patch size variations.

Combining all terms, L1+cGAN, performs similarly well.\nColorfulness A striking effect of conditional GANs is that they produce sharp images, hallucinating spatial structure even where it does not exist in the input label map. One might imagine cGANs have a similar effect on \u201csharpening\u201d in the spectral dimension \u2013 i.e. making images more colorful. Just as L1 will incentivize a blur when it is uncertain where exactly to locate an edge, it will also incentivize an average, grayish color when it is uncertain which of several plausible color values a pixel should take on. Specially, L1 will be minimized by choosing the median of of the conditional probability density function over possible colors. An adversarial loss, on the other hand, can in principle become aware that grayish outputs are unrealistic, and encourage matching the true color distribution [14]. In Figure 7, we investigate if our cGANs actually achieve this effect on the Cityscapes dataset. The plots show the marginal distri-\nbutions over output color values in Lab color space. The ground truth distributions are shown with a dotted line. It is apparent that L1 leads to a narrower distribution than the ground truth, confirming the hypothesis that L1 encourages average, grayish colors. Using a cGAN, on the other hand, pushes the output distribution closer to the ground truth."

Color histogram matching is a common problem in image processing [33], and PixelGANs may be a promising lightweight solution.\nUsing a 16\u00d716 PatchGAN is sufficient to promote sharp outputs, but also leads to tiling artifacts. The 70\u00d770 PatchGAN alleviates these artifacts. Scaling beyond this, to the full 256\u00d7 256 ImageGAN, does not appear to improve the visual quality of the results, and in fact gets a considerably lower FCN-score (Table 2). This may be because the ImageGAN has many more parameters and greater depth than the 70\u00d7 70 PatchGAN, and may be harder to train.\nFully- volutional translation An advantage of the PatchGAN is that a fixed-size patch discriminator can be applied to arbitrarily large images. We may also apply the generator convolutionally, on larger images than those on which it was trained. We test this on the map\u2194aerial photo task. After training a generator on 256\u00d7256 images, we test it on 512\u00d7512 images. The results in Figure 8 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.\n1We achieve this variation in patch size by adjusting th depth of the GAN discriminator. Details of this process, and the discriminator architectures are provided in the appendix\nClassification Ours L2 [46] (rebal.)

Results of our AMT experiment for map\u2194photo are given in Table 3. The aerial photos generated by our method fooled participants on 18.9% of trials, significantly above the L1 baseline, which produces blurry results and nearly never fooled participants. In contrast, in the photo\u2192map directionm our method only fooled participants on 6.1% of trials, and this was not significantly different than the performance of the L1 baseline (based on bootstrap test). This may be because minor structural errors are more visible in maps, which have rigid geometry, than in aerial photographs, which are more chaotic.\nWe trained colorization on ImageNet [35], and tested on the test split introduced by [46, 23]. Our method, with L1+cGAN loss, fooled participants on 22.5% of trials (Table 4). We also tested the results of [46] and a variant of their method that used an L2 loss (see [46] for details). The conditional GAN scored similarly to the L2 variant of [46] (difference insignificant by bootstrap test), but fell short of [46]\u2019s full method, which fooled participants on 27.8% of trials in our experiment. We note that their method was specifically engineered to do well on colorization."

            "text": "Conditional GANs appear to be effective on problems where the output is highly detailed or photographic, as is common in image processing and graphics tasks. What about vision problems, like semantic segmentation, where the output is instead less complex than the input?\nTo begin to test this, we train a cGAN (with/without L1 loss) on cityscape photo\u2192labels. Figure 10 shows qualitative results, and quantitative classification accuracies are reported in Table 5. Interestingly, cGANs, trained without the L1 loss, are able to solve this problem at a reasonable degree of accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of GANs successfully generating \u201clabels\u201d, which are nearly discrete, rather than \u201cimages\u201d, with their continuousvalued variation2. Although cGANs achieve some success, they are far from the best available method for solving this problem: simply using L1 regression gets better scores than using a cGAN, as shown in Table 5. We argue that for vision problems, the goal (i.e. predicting output close to ground truth) may be less ambiguous than graphics tasks, and reconstruction losses like L1 are mostly sufficient."
