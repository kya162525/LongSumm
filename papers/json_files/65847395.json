    "abstractText": "Unsupervised learning of probabilistic models is a central yet challenging problem in machine learning. Specifically, designing models with tractable learning, sampling, inference and evaluation is crucial in solving this task. We extend the space of such models using real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations, a set of powerful invertible and learnable transformations, resulting in an unsupervised learning algorithm with exact log-likelihood computation, exact sampling, exact inference of latent variables, and an interpretable latent space. We demonstrate its ability to model natural images on four datasets through sampling, log-likelihood evaluation and latent variable manipulations.",

However, unsupervised learning has the potential to leverage large pools of unlabeled data available to us, and extend these advances to modalities that are otherwise impractical or impossible.\nOne principled approach to unsupervised learning is generative probabilistic modeling. Not only do generative probabilistic models have the ability to create novel content, they also have a wide range of reconstruction related applications including inpainting [54, 39, 52], denoising [3], colorization [63], and super-resolution [7].\nAs data of interest are generally highly-dimensional and highly structured, the challenge in this domain is building models that are powerful enough to capture its complexity yet still trainable. We address this challenge by introducing real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations, a tractable yet expressive set of models for modeling high-dimensional data."

            "text": "Substantial work on probabilistic generative models has been focused on training models using maximum likelihood. When designing generative models, care needs to be taken to make both inference and learning tractable. These design choices are often expressed in terms of probabilistic graphical models. As these models rely on simple conditional distributions, the introduction of anonymous latent variables has been used to make these models more expressive.\nOccurrences of such models include probabilistic undirected graphs such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines [51] and Deep Boltzmann Machines [46]. These models were successfully trained by taking advantage of the conditional independence property of their bipartite structure to allow efficient exact\n\u2217Work was done when author was at Google Brain.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n08 80\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n7 M\nor approximate posterior inference on latent variables. However, because of the intractability of their associated marginal distribution, their training, evaluation and sampling procedures necessitate the use of approximations like Mean Field inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, whose convergence time for such complex models remains undetermined. Furthermore, these approximations can often hinder their performance [5].\nDirected graphical models rely on an ancestral sampling procedure, which is appealing both for its conceptual and computational simplicity. They lack, however, the conditional independence structure of undirected models, making exact and approximate posterior inference on latent variables cumbersome [49]. Recent advances in stochastic variational inference [22] and amortized inference [11, 36, 28, 42], allowed efficient approximate inference and learning of deep directed graphical models by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood [38]. In particular, the variational autoencoder algorithm [28, 42] simultaneously learns a generative network, that maps gaussian latent variables z to samples x, and semantically meaningful features by exploiting the reparametrization trick [60]. Its success in leveraging recent advances in backpropagation [44, 32] in deep neural networks resulted in its adoption for several applications ranging from speech synthesis [10] to language modeling [6]. Still, the approximation in the inference process limits its ability to learn high dimensional deep representations, motivating recent work in improving approximate inference [35, 41, 48, 56, 8, 52].\nSuch approximations can be avoided altogether by abstaining from using latent variables. Autoregressive models [15, 30] can implement this strategy while typically retaining a great deal of flexibility. This class of algorithms tractably models the joint distribution by decomposing it into a product of conditionals using the probability chain rule according to an fixed ordering over dimensions, simplifying log-likelihood evaluation and sampling. Recent work in this line of research have successfully taken advantage of recent advances in recurrent networks [44], in particular longshort term memory [21], and residual networks [20, 19] in order to learn state-of-the-art generative image models [54, 39] and language models [26]. But the ordering of the dimensions, although often arbitrary, can be critical to the training of the model [59]. The sequential nature of this model limits its computational efficiency. For example, its sampling procedure is sequential and non-parallelizable. Additionally, there is no natural latent representation associated with autoregressive models, and they have not been shown to be useful for semi-supervised learning.\nGenerative adversarial networks [17] on the other hand can train any differentiable generative network by avoiding the maximum likelihood principle altogether. Instead, the generative network is associated with a discriminator network whose task is to distinguish between samples and real data. Rather than using an intractable log-likelihood, this discriminator network provides the training signal in an adversarial fashion. Successfully trained GAN models [17, 12, 40] can consistently generate sharp and realistically looking samples [31]. However, metrics that measure the diversity in the generated samples are currently intractable [55, 18]. Additionally, instability in their training process [40] requires careful hyperparameter tuning to avoid diverging behaviors.\nGiven the constraints of bijectivity, training a generative network g would be theoretically possible using the change of variable formula:\npX(x) = pZ(z) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223det(\u2202g(z)\u2202z )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22121 . (1)\nThis formula has been mentioned in several papers including the maximum likelihood formulation of independent components analysis (ICA) [4, 23], gaussianization [9] and deep density models [43, 14, 3]. However, as a naive application of this formula is in general impractical for highdimensional data, ICA practitioners preferred to use more tractable principle like ensemble learning [58]. As the existence proof of nonlinear ICA solutions [24] suggests, auto-regressive models can be seen as tractable instance of maximum likelihood nonlinear ICA, where the residual corresponds to the independent components."

Building on our previous work in [14], we will define a powerful class of bijective functions which will enable exact and tractable density evaluation and exact and tractable inference. These bijections will tie the sampling and inference processes, which will make exact sampling as efficient as exact inference. Moreover, the increased flexibility will allow us not to rely on a fixed form reconstruction cost such as square error [31, 40], and output sharper samples from trained models as a consequence. Also, this flexibility will help us leverage recent advances in batch normalization [25] and residual networks [19, 20]."

As computing the Jacobian determinant of the transformation is crucial to effectively train using this principle, our work exploits the simple observation that the determinant of a triangular matrix can be efficiently computed as the product of its diagonal terms.\nWe will build a flexible and tractable bijective function by stacking a sequence of simple bijections. In each simple bijection, part of the input vector is updated using a function which is simple to invert, but which depends on the remainder of the input vector in a complex way. We refer to each of these simple bijections as an affine coupling layer. Given a D dimensional input x and d < D, the output y of an affine coupling layer follows the equations\ny1:d = x1:d (4) yd+1:D = xd+1:D exp ( l(x1:d) ) +m(x1:d), (5)\nwhere l and m are functions Rd 7\u2192 RD\u2212d and is the Hadamard product or element-wise product (see Figure 2(a))."

The squeezing operation transforms an s \u00d7 s \u00d7 c tensor into an s2 \u00d7 s 2 \u00d7 4c tensor (see Figure 3), effectively trading spatial size for number of channels.\nAt each scale, we combine several operations into a sequence: we first apply three coupling layers with alternating checkerboard masks, then perform a squeezing operation, and finally apply three more coupling layers with channel-wise masking. The channel-wise masking is chosen so that the resulting partitioning is not redundant with the previous checkerboard masking (see Figure 3). For the final scale, we only apply four coupling layers in with alternating checkerboard masks.\nPropagating a D dimensional vector through all the coupling layers would be cumbersome, in terms of computational and memory cost, and in terms of the number of parameters that would need to be trained. For this reason we follow the design choice of [50] and factor out half of the dimensions at\nregular intervals (see Equation 11). We can define this operation recursively (see Figure 4(b)),\nh(0) = x (10)\n(z(i+1), h(i+1)) = f (i+1)(h(i)) (11)\nz(L) = f (L)(h(L\u22121)) (12)\nz = (z(1), . . . , z(L)). (13)\nIn our experiments, for i < L. The sequence of coupling-squeezing-coupling operations described above is performed per layer when computing f (i) (Equation 11). At each layer, as the spatial resolution is reduced, the number of hidden layer features in l and m is doubled. All variables which have been factored out are concatenated to obtain the final transformed output (Equation 13).\nAs a consequence, the model must first Gaussianize layers which are factored out at an earlier layer. This follows a philosophy similar to guiding intermediate layers using intermediate classifiers [33], and having multiple layers of latent variables which represent different levels of abstraction [46, 42]."

As described in Appendix E we introduce and use a novel variant of batch normalization which is based on a running average over recent minibatches, and is thus more robust when training with very small minibatches.\nWe also use apply batch normalization to the whole coupling layer output. The effects of batch normalization are easily included in the Jacobian computation, since it acts as a linear rescaling on each dimension. This form of batch normalization can be seen as similar to reward normalization in deep reinforcement learning [37]."

For examples, the pixel values of an image typically lie in [0, 256]D after application of the recommended jittering procedure [57, 55]. In order to reduce the impact of boundary effects, we instead model the density of logit(\u03b1+(1\u2212\u03b1) x), where \u03b1 is picked here as .05. We take into account this transformation when computing log-likelihood and bits per dimension. We also use horizontal flips for CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN.\nWe train our model on four natural image datasets: CIFAR-10 [29], Imagenet [45], Large-scale Scene Understanding (LSUN) [62], CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) [34]. More specifically, we train on the downsampled to 32\u00d7 32 and 64\u00d7 64 versions of Imagenet [39]. For the LSUN dataset, we train on the bedroom, tower and church outdoor categories. The procedure for LSUN is the same as in [40]: we downsample the image so that the smallest side is 96 pixels and take random crops of 64\u00d7 64. For CelebA, we use the same procedure as in [31].\nWe use the multi-scale architecture described in Section 3.6 and use deep convolutional residual networks in the coupling layers with skip-connections as suggested by [39]. Our multi-scale architecture is repeated recursively until the input of the last recursion is a 4\u00d7 4\u00d7 c tensor. For datasets of images of size 32\u00d7 32, we use 4 residual blocks with 32 hidden feature maps for the first coupling layers with checkerboard masking. Only 2 residual blocks are used for images of size 64\u00d7 64. We use a batch size of 64. For CIFAR-10, we use 8 residual blocks, 64 feature maps, and downscale only once. We optimize with ADAM [27] with default hyperparameters.\nWe set the prior pZ to be an isotropic unit norm Gaussian. However, any distribution could be used for pZ , including distributions that are also learned during training, such as from an auto-regressive model, or (with slight modifications to the training objective) a variational autoencoder."

            "text": "We show in Table 1 that the number of bits per dimension, while not improving over the Pixel RNN [39] baseline, is competitive with other generative methods. As we notice that our performance increases with the number of parameters, larger models are likely to further improve performance. For CelebA and LSUN, the bits per dimension for the validation set was decreasing throughout training, so little overfitting is expected.\nWe show in Figure 5 samples generated from the model with training examples from the dataset for comparison. As mentioned in [55, 18], maximum likelihood is a principle that values diversity over sample quality in a limited capacity setting. As a result, our model outputs sometimes highly improbable samples as we can notice especially on CelebA. As opposed to variational autoencoders, the samples generated from our model look not only globally coherent but also sharp. Our hypothesis is that as opposed to these models, real NVP does not rely on fixed form reconstruction cost like an L2 norm which tends to reward capturing low frequency components more heavily than high frequency components. On Imagenet and LSUN, our model seems to have captured well the notion\nof background/foreground and lighting interactions such as luminosity and consistent light source direction for reflectance and shadows.\nWe also illustrate the smooth semantically consistent meaning of our latent variables. In the latent space, we define a manifold based on four validation examples z(1), z(2), z(3), z(4), and parametrized by two parameters \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2032 by,\nz = cos(\u03c6) ( cos(\u03c6\u2032)z(1) + sin(\u03c6 \u2032)z(2) ) + sin(\u03c6) ( cos(\u03c6\u2032)z(3) + sin(\u03c6 \u2032)z(4) ) . (14)\nWe project the resulting manifold back into the data space by computing g(z). Results are shown Figure 6. We observe that the model seems to have organized the latent space with a notion of meaning that goes well beyond pixel space interpolation. More visualization are shown in the Appendix."

We have shown that this class of generative model achieves competitive performances, both in terms of sample quality and log-likelihood. Many avenues exist to further improve the functional form of the transformations, for instance by exploiting the latest advances in dilated convolutions [61] and residual networks architectures [53]\nThis paper presented a technique bridging the gap between auto-regressive models, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Like auto-regressive models, it allows tractable and exact log-likelihood evaluation for training. It allows however a much more flexible functional form and, similar to variational autoencoders, it can define a meaningful latent space. Finally, like generative adversarial networks, our technique does not require the use of a fixed form reconstruction cost, and instead defines a cost in terms of higher level features, generating sharper images.\nNot only can this generative model be conditioned to create a structured output algorithm but, as the resulting class of invertible transformations can be treated as a probability distribution in a modular way, it can also be used to improve upon other probabilistic models like auto-regressive models and variational autoencoders. For variational autoencoders, these transformations could be used both to design more interesting reconstruction cost [31] and to augment stochastic inference models [41]. Probabilistic models in general can also benefit from batch normalization techniques as applied in this paper."
