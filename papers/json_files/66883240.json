    "abstractText": "We propose the task of free-form and open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA). Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world scenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and answers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing \u223c0.25M images, \u223c0.76M questions, and \u223c10M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the information it provides. Numerous baselines and methods for VQA are provided and compared with human performance.",

            "text": "We are witnessing a renewed excitement in multi-discipline Artificial Intelligence (AI) research problems. In particular, research in image and video captioning that combines Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KR) has dramatically increased in the past year [14], [7], [10], [36], [24], [22], [51]. Part of this excitement stems from a belief that multi-discipline tasks like image captioning are a step towards solving AI. However, the current state of the art demonstrates that a coarse scene-level understanding of an image paired with word n-gram statistics suffices to generate reasonable image captions, which suggests image captioning may not be as \u201cAI-complete\u201d as desired. What makes for a compelling \u201cAI-complete\u201d task? We believe that in order to spawn the next generation of AI algorithms, an ideal task should (i) require multi-modal knowledge beyond a single sub-domain (such as CV) and (ii) have a well-defined quantitative evaluation metric to track progress. For some tasks, such as image captioning, automatic evaluation is still a difficult and open research problem [49], [11], [20]. In this paper, we introduce the task of free-form and openended Visual Question Answering (VQA). A VQA system takes as input an image and a free-form, open-ended, naturallanguage question about the image and produces a naturallanguage answer as the output. This goal-driven task is applicable to scenarios encountered when visually-impaired users [2] or intelligence analysts actively elicit visual information. Example questions are shown in Fig. 1. Open-ended questions require a potentially vast set of AI capabilities to answer \u2013 fine-grained recognition (e.g., \u201cWhat kind of cheese is on the pizza?\u201d), object detection (e.g., \u201cHow many bikes are there?\u201d), activity recognition (e.g., \u201cIs this man\n\u2022 \u2217The first three authors contributed equally. \u2022 A. Agrawal, J. Lu, S. Antol, D. Batra and D. Parikh are with Virginia Tech. \u2022 M. Mitchell is with Microsoft Research, Redmond. \u2022 C. L. Zitnick is with Facebook AI Research.\ncrying?\u201d), knowledge base reasoning (e.g., \u201cIs this a vegetarian pizza?\u201d), and commonsense reasoning (e.g., \u201cDoes this person have 20/20 vision?\u201d, \u201cIs this person expecting company?\u201d). VQA [17], [34], [48], [2] is also amenable to automatic quantitative evaluation, making it possible to effectively track progress on this task. While the answer to many questions is simply \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, the process for determining a correct answer is typically far from trivial (e.g. in Fig. 1, \u201cDoes this person have 20/20 vision?\u201d). Moreover, since questions about images often tend to seek specific information, simple oneto-three word answers are sufficient for many questions. In such scenarios, we can easily evaluate a proposed algorithm by the number of questions it answers correctly. In this paper, we present both an open-ended answering task and a multiplechoice task [43], [31]. Unlike the open-ended task that requires a free-form response, the multiple-choice task only requires an algorithm to pick from a predefined list of possible answers.\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n00 46\n8v 6\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n0 A\npr 2\n01 6\n2 We present a large dataset that contains 204,721 images from the MS COCO dataset [30] and a newly created abstract scene dataset [55], [1] that contains 50,000 scenes. The MS COCO dataset has images depicting diverse and complex scenes that are effective at eliciting compelling and diverse questions. We collected a new dataset of \u201crealistic\u201d abstract scenes to enable research focused only on the high-level reasoning required for VQA by removing the need to parse real images. Three questions were collected for each image or scene. Each question was answered by ten subjects along with their confidence. The dataset contains over 760K questions with around 10M answers. While the use of open-ended questions offers many benefits, it is still useful to understand the types of questions that are being asked and which types various algorithms may be good at answering. To this end, we analyze the types of questions asked and the types of answers provided. Through several visualizations, we demonstrate the astonishing diversity of the questions asked. We also explore how the information content of questions and their answers differs from image captions. For baselines, we offer several approaches that use a combination of both text and state-of-the-art visual features [27]. As part of the VQA initiative, we will organize an annual challenge and associated workshop to discuss state-of-the-art methods and best practices. VQA poses a rich set of challenges, many of which have been viewed as the holy grail of automatic image understanding and AI in general. However, it includes as building blocks several components that the CV, NLP, and KR [4], [6], [29], [33], [3] communities have made significant progress on during the past few decades. VQA provides an attractive balance between pushing the state of the art, while being accessible enough for the communities to start making progress on the task."

            "text": "VQA Efforts. Several recent papers have begun to study visual question answering [17], [34], [48], [2]. However, unlike our work, these are fairly restricted (sometimes synthetic) settings with small datasets. For instance, [34] only considers questions whose answers come from a predefined closed world of 16 basic colors or 894 object categories. [17] also considers questions generated from templates from a fixed vocabulary of objects, attributes, relationships between objects, etc. In contrast, our proposed task involves open-ended, free-form questions and answers provided by humans. Our goal is to increase the diversity of knowledge and kinds of reasoning needed to provide correct answers. Critical to achieving success on this more difficult and unconstrained task, our VQA dataset is two orders of magnitude larger than [17], [34] (>250,000 vs. 2,591 and 1,449 images respectively). The proposed VQA task has connections to other related work: [48] has studied joint parsing of videos and corresponding text to answer queries on two datasets containing 15 video clips each. [2] uses crowdsourced workers to answer questions about visual content asked by visually-impaired users. In concurrent work, [35] proposed combining an LSTM for the question with a CNN for the image to generate an answer \u2013 a similar model\nis evaluated in this paper. [32] generates abstract scenes to capture visual common sense relevant to answering (purely textual) fill-in-the-blank and visual paraphrasing questions. [45] and [50] use visual information to assess the plausibility of common sense assertions. [53] introduced a dataset of 10k images and prompted captions that describe specific aspects of a scene (e.g., individual objects, what will happen next). Concurrent with our work, [16] collected questions & answers in Chinese (later translated to English by humans) for COCO images. [42] automatically generated four types of questions (object, count, color, location) using COCO captions. Text-based Q&A is a well studied problem in the NLP and text processing communities (recent examples being [13], [12], [52], [43]). Other related textual tasks include sentence completion (e.g., [43] with multiple-choice answers). These approaches provide inspiration for VQA techniques. One key concern in text is the grounding of questions. For instance, [52] synthesized textual descriptions and QA-pairs grounded in a simulation of actors and objects in a fixed set of locations. VQA is naturally grounded in images \u2013 requiring the understanding of both text (questions) and vision (images). Our questions are generated by humans, making the need for commonsense knowledge and complex reasoning more essential. Describing Visual Content. Related to VQA are the tasks of image tagging [9], [27], image captioning [28], [15], [38], [7], [14], [51], [10], [22], [36], [24] and video captioning [44], [19], where words or sentences are generated to describe visual content. While these tasks require both visual and semantic knowledge, captions can often be non-specific (e.g., observed by [51]). The questions in VQA require detailed specific information about the image for which generic image captions are of little use [2]. Other Vision+Language Tasks. Several recent papers have explored tasks at the intersection of vision and language that are easier to evaluate than image captioning, such as coreference resolution [26], [41] or generating referring expressions [23], [40] for a particular object in an image that would allow a human to identify which object is being referred to (e.g., \u201cthe one in a red shirt\u201d, \u201cthe dog on the left\u201d). While task-driven and concrete, a limited set of visual concepts (e.g., color, location) tend to be captured by referring expressions. As we demonstrate, a richer variety of visual concepts emerge from visual questions and their answers."

Next, we describe our process of collecting questions and their corresponding answers. Analysis of the questions and answers gathered as well as baselines\u2019 & methods\u2019 results are provided in following sections. Real Images. We use the 123,287 training and validation images and 81,434 test images from the newly-released Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) [30] dataset. The MS COCO dataset was gathered to find images containing\nmultiple objects and rich contextual information. Given the visual complexity of these images, they are well-suited for our VQA task. The more diverse our collection of images, the more diverse, comprehensive, and interesting the resultant set of questions and their answers. Abstract Scenes. The VQA task with real images requires the use of complex and often noisy visual recognizers. To attract researchers interested in exploring the high-level reasoning required for VQA, but not the low-level vision tasks, we create a new abstract scenes dataset [1], [55], [56], [57] containing 50K scenes. The dataset contains 20 \u201cpaperdoll\u201d human models [1] spanning genders, races, and ages with 8 different expressions. The limbs are adjustable to allow for continuous pose variations. The clipart may be used to depict both indoor and outdoor scenes. The set contains over 100 objects and 31 animals in various poses. The use of this clipart enables the creation of more realistic scenes (see bottom row of Fig. 2) that more closely mirror real images than previous papers [55], [56], [57]. See the appendix for the user interface, additional details, and examples. Splits. For real images, we follow the same train/val/test split strategy as the MC COCO dataset [30] (including testdev, test-standard, test-challenge, test-reserve). For abstract scenes, we create standard splits, separating the scenes into 20K/10K/20K for train/val/test splits, respectively. Captions. The MS COCO dataset [30], [5] already contains five single-sentence captions for all images. We also collected five single-captions for all abstract scenes using the same user interface1 for collection. Questions. Collecting interesting, diverse, and well-posed questions is a significant challenge. Many simple questions may only require low-level computer vision knowledge, such as \u201cWhat color is the cat?\u201d or \u201cHow many chairs are present in the scene?\u201d. However, we also want questions that require commonsense knowledge about the scene, such as \u201cWhat sound does the pictured animal make?\u201d. Importantly, questions should also require the image to correctly answer and not be answerable using just commonsense information, e.g., in Fig. 1, \u201cWhat is the mustache made of?\u201d. By having a wide variety of question types and difficulty, we may be able to measure the continual progress of both visual understanding and commonsense reasoning. We tested and evaluated a number of user interfaces for collecting such \u201cinteresting\u201d questions. Specifically, we ran pilot studies asking human subjects to ask questions about a given image that they believe a \u201ctoddler\u201d, \u201calien\u201d, or \u201csmart robot\u201d would have trouble answering. We found the \u201csmart robot\u201d interface to elicit the most interesting and diverse questions. As shown in the appendix, our final interface stated:\n1. https://github.com/tylin/coco-ui\n4 \u201cWe have built a smart robot. It understands a lot about images. It can recognize and name all the objects, it knows where the objects are, it can recognize the scene (e.g., kitchen, beach), people\u2019s expressions and poses, and properties of objects (e.g., color of objects, their texture). Your task is to stump this smart robot! Ask a question about this scene that this smart robot probably can not answer, but any human can easily answer while looking at the scene in the image.\u201d\nTo bias against generic image-independent questions, subjects were instructed to ask questions that require the image to answer. The same user interface was used for both the real images and abstract scenes. In total, three questions from unique workers were gathered for each image/scene. When writing a question, the subjects were shown the previous questions already asked for that image to increase the question diversity. In total, the dataset contains over \u223c0.76M questions. Answers. Open-ended questions result in a diverse set of possible answers. For many questions, a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d response is sufficient. However, other questions may require a short phrase. Multiple different answers may also be correct. For instance, the answers \u201cwhite\u201d, \u201ctan\u201d, or \u201coff-white\u201d may all be correct answers to the same question. Human subjects may also disagree on the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer, e.g., some saying \u201cyes\u201d while others say \u201cno\u201d. To handle these discrepancies, we gather 10 answers for each question from unique workers, while also ensuring that the worker answering a question did not ask it. We ask the subjects to provide answers that are \u201ca brief phrase and not a complete sentence. Respond matter-offactly and avoid using conversational language or inserting your opinion.\u201d In addition to answering the questions, the subjects were asked \u201cDo you think you were able to answer the question correctly?\u201d and given the choices of \u201cno\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, and \u201cyes\u201d. See the appendix for more details about the user interface to collect answers. See Section 4 for an analysis of the answers provided. For testing, we offer two modalities for answering the questions: (i) open-ended and (ii) multiple-choice. For the open-ended task, the generated answers are evaluated using the following accuracy metric:\naccuracy = min( # humans that provided that answer\n3 , 1)\ni.e., an answer is deemed 100% accurate if at least 3 workers provided that exact answer.2 Before comparison, all responses are made lowercase, numbers converted to digits, and punctuation & articles removed. We avoid using soft metrics such as Word2Vec [37], since they often group together words that we wish to distinguish, such as \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d. For multiple-choice task, 18 candidate answers are created for each question. As with the open-ended task, the accuracy of a chosen option is computed based on the number of human subjects who provided that answer (divided by 3 and clipped at 1). We generate a candidate set of correct and incorrect answers from four sets of answers: Correct: The\n2. In order to be consistent with \u2018human accuracies\u2019 reported in Section 4, machine accuracies are averaged over all (10 9 ) sets of human annotators\nmost common (out of ten) correct answer. Plausible: To generate incorrect, but still plausible answers we ask three subjects to answer the questions without seeing the image. See the appendix for more details about the user interface to collect these answers. If three unique answers are not found, we gather additional answers from nearest neighbor questions using a bag-of-words model. The use of these answers helps ensure the image, and not just commonsense knowledge, is necessary to answer the question. Popular: These are the 10 most popular answers. For instance, these are \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201cwhite\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, \u201cred\u201d, \u201cblue\u201d, \u201c4\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d for real images. The inclusion of the most popular answers makes it more difficult for algorithms to infer the type of question from the set of answers provided, i.e., learning that it is a \u201cyes or no\u201d question just because \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d are present in the answers. Random: Correct answers from random questions in the dataset. To generate a total of 18 candidate answers, we first find the union of the correct, plausible, and popular answers. We include random answers until 18 unique answers are found. The order of the answers is randomized. Example multiple choice questions are in the appendix."

Other questions such as \u201cWhat is. . . \u201d and \u201cWhat type. . . \u201d have a rich diversity of responses. Other question types such as \u201cWhat color. . . \u201d or \u201cWhich. . . \u201d have more specialized responses, such as colors, or \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d. See the appendix for a list of the most popular answers. Lengths. Most answers consist of a single word, with the distribution of answers containing one, two, or three words, respectively being 89.32%, 6.91%, and 2.74% for real images and 90.51%, 5.89%, and 2.49% for abstract scenes. The brevity of answers is not surprising, since the questions tend to elicit specific information from the images. This is in contrast with image captions that generically describe the entire image and hence tend to be longer. The brevity of our answers makes automatic evaluation feasible. While it may be tempting to believe the brevity of the answers makes the problem easier, recall that they are human-provided open-ended answers to\nopen-ended questions. The questions typically require complex reasoning to arrive at these deceptively simple answers (see Fig. 2). There are currently 23,234 unique one-word answers in our dataset for real images and 3,770 for abstract scenes. \u2018Yes/No\u2019 and \u2018Number\u2019 Answers. Many questions are answered using either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d (or sometimes \u201cmaybe\u201d) \u2013 38.37% and 40.66% of the questions on real images and abstract scenes respectively. Among these \u2018yes/no\u2019 questions, there is a bias towards \u201cyes\u201d \u2013 58.83% and 55.86% of \u2018yes/no\u2019 answers are \u201cyes\u201d for real images and abstract scenes. Question types such as \u201cHow many. . . \u201d are answered using numbers \u2013 12.31% and 14.48% of the questions on real images and abstract scenes are \u2018number\u2019 questions. \u201c2\u201d is the most popular answer among the \u2018number\u2019 questions, making up 26.04% of the \u2018number\u2019 answers for real images and 39.85% for abstract scenes. Subject Confidence. When the subjects answered the questions, we asked \u201cDo you think you were able to answer the question correctly?\u201d. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of responses. A majority of the answers were labeled as confident for both real images and abstract scenes. Inter-human Agreement. Does the self-judgment of confidence correspond to the answer agreement between subjects? Fig. 6 shows the percentage of questions in which (i) 7 or more, (ii) 3\u22127, or (iii) less than 3 subjects agree on the answers given their average confidence score (0 = not confident, 1 = confident). As expected, the agreement between subjects increases with confidence. However, even if all of the subjects are confident the answers may still vary. This is not surprising since some answers may vary, yet have very similar meaning, such as \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cjoyful\u201d. As shown in Table 1 (Question + Image), there is significant inter-human agreement in the answers for both real images (83.30%) and abstract scenes (87.49%). Note that on average\n6 Answers with Images\neach question has 2.70 unique answers for real images and 2.39 for abstract scenes. The agreement is significantly higher\n(> 95%) for \u201cyes/no\u201d questions and lower for other questions (< 76%), possibly due to the fact that we perform exact string matching and do not account for synonyms, plurality, etc. Note that the automatic determination of synonyms is a difficult problem, since the level of answer granularity can vary across questions."

            "heading": "4.3 Commonsense Knowledge",
            "text": "Is the Image Necessary? Clearly, some questions can sometimes be answered correctly using commonsense knowledge alone without the need for an image, e.g., \u201cWhat is the color of the fire hydrant?\u201d. We explore this issue by asking three subjects to answer the questions without seeing the image (see the examples in blue in Fig. 2). In Table 1 (Question), we show the percentage of questions for which the correct answer\nis provided over all questions, \u201cyes/no\u201d questions, and the other questions that are not \u201cyes/no\u201d. For \u201cyes/no\u201d questions, the human subjects respond better than chance. For other questions, humans are only correct about 21% of the time. This demonstrates that understanding the visual information is critical to VQA and that commonsense information alone is not sufficient. To show the qualitative difference in answers provided with and without images, we show the distribution of answers for various question types in Fig. 5 (bottom). The distribution of colors, numbers, and even \u201cyes/no\u201d responses is surprisingly different for answers with and without images. Which Questions Require Common Sense? In order to identify questions that require commonsense reasoning to answer, we conducted two AMT studies (on a subset 10K questions from the real images of VQA trainval) asking subjects \u2013\n1) Whether or not they believed a question required commonsense to answer the question, and 2) The youngest age group that they believe a person must be in order to be able to correctly answer the question \u2013 toddler (3-4), younger child (5-8), older child (9-12), teenager (13-17), adult (18+).\nEach question was shown to 10 subjects. We found that for 47.43% of questions 3 or more subjects voted \u2018yes\u2019 to commonsense, (18.14%: 6 or more). In the \u2018perceived human age required to answer question\u2019 study, we found the following distribution of responses: toddler: 15.3%, younger child: 39.7%, older child: 28.4%, teenager: 11.2%, adult: 5.5%. In Figure 7 we show several questions for which a majority of subjects picked the specified age range. Surprisingly the perceived age needed to answer the questions is fairly well distributed across the different age ranges. As expected the questions that were judged answerable by an adult (18+) generally need specialized knowledge, whereas those answerable by a toddler (3-4) are more generic. We measure the degree of commonsense required to answer a question as the percentage of subjects (out of 10) who voted \u201cyes\u201d in our \u201cwhether or not a question requires commonsense\u201d study. A fine-grained breakdown of average age and average degree of common sense (on a scale of 0 \u2212 100) required to answer a question is shown in Table 3. The average age and the average degre of commonsense across all questions is 8.92 and 31.01% respectively.\nIt is important to distinguish between: 1) How old someone needs to be to be able to answer a\nquestion correctly, and 2) How old people think someone needs to be to be able to\nanswer a question correctly. Our age annotations capture the latter \u2013 perceptions of MTurk workers in an uncontrolled environment. As such, the relative ordering of question types in Table 3 is more important than absolute age numbers. The two rankings of questions in terms of common sense required according to the two studies were largely correlated (Pearson\u2019s rank correlation: 0.58).\n4.4 Captions vs. Questions\nDo generic image captions provide enough information to answer the questions? Table 1 (Question + Caption) shows the percentage of questions answered correctly when human subjects are given the question and a human-provided caption describing the image, but not the image. As expected, the results are better than when humans are shown the questions alone. However, the accuracies are significantly lower than when subjects are shown the actual image. This demonstrates that in order to answer the questions correctly, deeper image understanding (beyond what image captions typically capture) is necessary. In fact, we find that the distributions of nouns, verbs, and adjectives mentioned in captions is statistically significantly different from those mentioned in our questions + answers (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < .001) for both real images and abstract scenes. See the appendix for details.\n8"

We choose the top K = 1000 most frequent answers as possible outputs. This set of answers covers 82.67% of the train+val answers. We describe the different components of our model below: Image Channel: This channel provides an embedding for the image. We experiment with two embeddings \u2013\n1) I: The activations from the last hidden layer of VGGNet [46] are used as 4096-dim image embedding. 2) norm I: These are `2 normalized activations from the last hidden layer of VGGNet [46].\nQuestion Channel: This channel provides an embedding for the question. We experiment with three embeddings \u2013\n1) Bag-of-Words Question (BoW Q): The top 1,000 words in the questions are used to create a bag-of-words representation. Since there is a strong correlation between the words that start a question and the answer (see Fig. 5), we find the top 10 first, second, and third words of\nthe questions and create a 30 dimensional bag-of-words representation. These features are concatenated to get a 1,030-dim embedding for the question. 2) LSTM Q: An LSTM with one hidden layer is used to obtain 1024-dim embedding for the question. Each question word is encoded with 300-dim embedding by a fully-connected layer + tanh non-linearity which is then fed to the LSTM. The input vocabulary to the embedding layer consists of all the question words seen in the training dataset. 3) deeper LSTM Q: An LSTM with two hidden layers is used to obtain 2048-dim embedding for the question, followed by a fully-connected layer + tanh non-linearity to transform 2048-dim embedding to 1024-dim. The question words are encoded in the same way as in LSTM Q.\nMulti-Layer Perceptron (MLP): The image and question embeddings are combined to obtain a single embedding.\n1) For BoW Q + I method, we simply concatenate the BoW Q and I embeddings. 2) For LSTM Q + I, and deeper LSTM Q + norm I (Fig. 8) methods, the image embedding is first transformed to 1024-dim by a fully-connected layer + tanh non-linearity to match the LSTM embedding of the question. The transformed image and LSTM embeddings (being in a common space) are then fused via element-wise multiplication.\nThis combined image + question embedding is then passed to an MLP \u2013 a fully connected neural network classifier with 2 hidden layers and 1000 hidden units (dropout 0.5) in each layer with tanh non-linearity, followed by a softmax layer to obtain a distribution over K answers. The entire model is learned end-to-end with a cross-entropy loss. VGGNet parameters are frozen to those learned for ImageNet classification and not fine-tuned in the image channel. We also experimented with providing captions as input to our model. Similar to Table 1, we assume that a human-generated caption is given as input. We use a bag-of-words representation containing the 1,000 most popular words in the captions as the caption embedding (Caption). For BoW Question + Caption (BoW Q + C) method, we simply concatenate the BoW Q and C embeddings. For testing, we report the result on two different tasks: openended selects the answer with highest activation from all possible K answers and multiple-choice picks the answer that has the highest activation from the potential answers."

            "text": "Table 2 shows the accuracy of our baselines and methods for both the open-ended and multiple-choice tasks on the VQA test-dev for real images. As expected, the vision-alone model (I) that completely ignores the question performs rather poorly (open-ended: 28.13% / multiple-choice: 30.53%). In fact, on open-ended task, the vision-alone model (I) performs worse than the prior (\u201cyes\u201d) baseline, which ignores both the image and question (responding to every question with a \u201cyes\u201d).\nInterestingly, the language-alone methods (per Q-type prior, BoW Q, LSTM Q) that ignore the image perform surprisingly well, with BoW Q achieving 48.09% on open-ended (53.68% on multiple-choice) and LSTM Q achieving 48.76% on openended (54.75% on multiple-choice); both outperforming the nearest neighbor baseline (open-ended: 42.70%, multiplechoice: 48.49%). Our quantitative results and analyses suggest that this might be due to the language-model exploiting subtle statistical priors about the question types (e.g. \u201cWhat color is the banana?\u201d can be answered with \u201cyellow\u201d without looking at the image). For a detailed discussion of the subtle biases in the questions, please see [54]. The accuracy of our best model (deeper LSTM Q + norm I (Fig. 8), selected using VQA test-dev accuracies) on VQA test-standard is 58.16% (open-ended) / 63.09% (multiple-choice). We can see that our model is able to significantly outperform both the vision-alone and languagealone baselines. As a general trend, results on multiple-choice are better than open-ended. All methods are significantly worse than human performance.\nTo gain further insights into these results, we computed accuracies by question type in Table 3. Interestingly, for question types that require more reasoning, such as \u201cIs the\u201d or \u201cHow many\u201d, the scene-level image features do not provide any additional information. However, for questions that can be answered using scene-level information, such as \u201cWhat sport,\u201d we do see an improvement. Similarly, for questions whose answer may be contained in a generic caption we see improvement, such as \u201cWhat animal\u201d. For all question types, the results are worse than human accuracies. We also analyzed the accuracies of our best model (deeper LSTM Q + norm I) on a subset of questions with certain specific (ground truth) answers. In Fig. 9, we show the average accuracy of the model on questions with 50 most frequent ground truth answers on the VQA validation set (plot is sorted by accuracy, not frequency). We can see that the model performs well for answers that are common visual objects such as \u201cwii\u201d, \u201ctennis\u201d, \u201cbathroom\u201d while the performance is somewhat underwhelming for counts (e.g., \u201c2\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c3\u201d), and particularly poor for higher counts (e.g., \u201c5\u201d, \u201c6\u201d, \u201c10\u201d, \u201c8\u201d, \u201c7\u201d). In Fig. 10, we show the distribution of 50 most frequently predicted answers when the system is correct on the VQA validation set (plot is sorted by prediction frequency, not accuracy). In this analysis, \u201csystem is correct\u201d implies that it has VQA accuracy 1.0 (see section 3 for accuracy metric). We can see that the frequent ground truth answers (e.g., \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201cwhite\u201d, \u201cred\u201d, \u201cblue\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d) are more frequently predicted than others when the model is correct. Finally, evaluating our best model (deeper LSTM Q + norm I) on the validation questions for which we have age annotations (how old a human needs to be to answer the question correctly), we estimate that our model performs as well as a 4.74 year old child! The average age required on the same set of questions is 8.98. Evaluating the same model on the validation questions for which we have commonsense\nannotations (whether the question requires commonsense to answer it), we estimate that it has degree of commonsense of 17.35%. The average degree of commonsense required on same set of questions is 31.23%. Again, these estimates reflect the age and commonsense perceived by MTurk workers that would be required to answer the question. See the appendix for details. We further analyzed the performance of the model for different age groups on the validation questions for which we have age annotations. In Fig. 11, we computed the average accuracy of the predictions made by the model for questions belonging to different age groups. Perhaps as expected, the accuracy of the model decreases as the age of the question increases (from 61.07% at 3\u2212 4 age group to 47.83% at 18+ age group). In Fig. 12, we show the distribution of age of questions for different levels of accuracies achieved by our system on the validation questions for which we have age annotations. It is interesting to see that the relative proportions of different age groups is consistent across all accuracy bins with questions belonging to the age group 5-8 comprising the majority of the predictions which is expected because 5-8 is the most common age group in the dataset (see Fig. 7)."

            "heading": "7 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In conclusion, we introduce the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). Given an image and an open-ended, natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. We provide a dataset containing over 250K images, 760K questions, and around 10M answers. We demonstrate the wide variety of questions and answers in our dataset, as well as the diverse set of AI capabilities in computer vision, natural language processing, and commonsense reasoning required to answer these questions accurately. The questions we solicited from our human subjects were open-ended and not task-specific. For some application domains, it would be useful to collect task-specific questions. For instance, questions may be gathered from subjects who are visually impaired [2], or the questions could focused on one specific domain (say sports). Bigham et al. [2] created an application that allows the visually impaired to capture images and ask open-ended questions that are answered by human subjects. Interestingly, these questions can rarely be answered using generic captions. Training on task-specific datasets may help enable practical VQA applications. We believe VQA has the distinctive advantage of pushing the frontiers on \u201cAI-complete\u201d problems, while being amenable\n4. http://www.visualqa.org/workshop.html 5. http://visualqa.org/challenge.html\n11\nto automatic evaluation.

            "text": "In the appendix, we provide:\nI - Additional analysis comparing captions and Q&A data II - Qualitative visualizations for \u201cWhat is\u201d questions\nIII - Human accuracy on multiple-choice questions IV - Details on VQA baselines V - \u201cAge\u201d and \u201cCommonsense\u201d of our model\nVI - Details on the abstract scene dataset VII - User interfaces used to collect the dataset\nVIII - List of the top answers in the dataset IX - Additional examples from the VQA dataset\nAPPENDIX I: CAPTIONS vs. QUESTIONS Do questions and answers provide further information about the visual world beyond that captured by captions? One method for determining whether the information captured by questions & answers is different from the information captured by captions is to measure some of the differences in the word distributions from the two datasets. We cast this comparison in terms of nouns, verbs, and adjectives by extracting all words from the caption data (MS COCO captions for real images and captions collected by us for abstract scenes) using the Stanford part-of-speech (POS)6 tagger [47]. We normalize the word frequencies from captions, questions, and answers\n6. Noun tags begin with NN, verb tags begin with VB, adjective tags begin with JJ, and prepositions are tagged as IN.\n12\nper image, and compare captions vs. questions and answers combined. Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine whether the underlying distributions of the two datasets differ, we find a significant difference for all three parts of speech (p < .001) for both real images and abstract scenes. This helps motivate the VQA task as a way to learn information about visual scenes; although both captions and questions & answers provide information about the visual world, they do it from different perspectives, with different underlying biases [18], and can function as complementary to one another. We illustrate the similarities and differences between the word distributions in captions versus questions & answers as Vennstyle word clouds [8] with size indicating the normalized count. These are shown in Fig. 15 (nouns), Fig. 16 (verbs), and Fig. 17 (adjectives) for real images and Fig. 18 (nouns), Fig. 19 (verbs), and Fig. 20 (adjectives) for abstract scenes.7 The left side shows the top words in captions, the right the top words in questions & answers, and the center the words common to both, with size indicating the harmonic mean of the counts. Qualitatively, we see that adjectives in captions capture some clearly visual properties discussed in previous work on vision to language [39], such as material and pattern, while the questions & answers have more adjectives that capture what is usual (e.g., \u201cdominant\u201d, \u201capproximate\u201d, \u201chigher\u201d) and other kinds of commonsense properties (e.g., \u201cedible\u201d, \u201cpossible\u201d,\n7. Visualization created using http://worditout.com/.\n\u201cunsafe\u201d, \u201cacceptable\u201d). Interestingly, we see that question & answer nouns capture information about \u201cethnicity\u201d and \u201chairstyle\u201d, while caption nouns capture information about pluralized visible objects (e.g., \u201ccellphones\u201d, \u201cdaughters\u201d) and groups (e.g., \u201ctrio\u201d, \u201csome\u201d), among other differences. \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d are common in both captions and questions & answers. One key piece to understanding the visual world is understanding spatial relationships, and so we additionally extract spatial prepositions and plot their proportions in the captions vs. the questions & answers data in Fig. 14 (left) for real images and Fig. 14 (right) for abstract scenes. We see that questions & answers have a higher proportion of specific spatial relations (i.e., \u201cin\u201d, \u201con\u201d) compared to captions, which have a higher proportion of general spatial relations (i.e., \u201cwith\u201d, \u201cnear\u201d).\n13\n14\n15\nAPPENDIX II: \u201cWHAT IS\u201d ANALYSIS In Fig. 21, we show the distribution of questions starting with \u201cWhat is\u201d by their first five words for both real images and abstract scenes. Note the diversity of objects referenced in the questions, as well as, the relations between objects, such as \u201cholding\u201d and \u201csitting on\u201d. In Fig. 22, we show the distribution of answers for \u201cWhat is\u201d questions ending in different words. For instance, questions ending in \u201ceating\u201d have answers such as \u201cpizza\u201d, \u201cwatermelon\u201d and \u201chot dog\u201d. Notice the diversity in answers for some questions, such as those that end with \u201cfor?\u201d or \u201cpicture?\u201d. Other questions result in intuitive responses, such as \u201cholding?\u201d and the response \u201cumbrella\u201d.\nAPPENDIX III: MULTIPLE-CHOICE HUMAN ACCURACY\nTo compute human accuracy for multiple-choice questions, we collected three human answers per question on a random subset of 3,000 questions for both real images and abstract scenes. In Table 5, we show the human accuracies for multiple choice questions. Table 5 also shows the inter-human agreement for open-ended answer task. In comparison to openended answer, the multiple-choice accuracies are more or less same for \u201cyes/no\u201d questions and significantly better (\u2248 15% increase for real images and \u2248 11% increase for abstract scenes) for \u201cother\u201d questions. Since \u201cother\u201d questions may be ambiguous, the increase in accuracy using multiple choice is not surprising.\nAPPENDIX IV: DETAILS ON VQA BASELINES \u201cper Q-type prior\u201d baseline. We decide on different question types based on first few words of questions in the real images training set and ensure that each question type has at least 30 questions in the training dataset. The most popular answer for each question type is also computed on real images training set. \u201cnearest neighbor\u201d baseline. For every question in the VQA test-standard set, we find its k nearest neighbor questions\nin the training set using cosine similarity in Skip-Thought [25] feature space. We also experimented with bag of words and Word2Vec [37] feature spaces but we obtained the best performance with Skip-Thought. In this set of k questions and their associated images, we find the image which is most similar to the query image using cosine similarity in fc7 feature space. We use the fc7 features from the caffenet model in BVLC Caffe [21]. The most common ground truth answer of this most similar image and question pair is the predicted answer for the query image and question pair. We pick k = 4 on the test-dev set.\nAPPENDIX V: \u201cAGE\u201d AND \u201cCOMMONSENSE\u201d"

To estimate the age, we compute a weighted average of the average age per question, weighted by the accuracy of the model\u2019s predicted answer for that question, on the subset of questions in the VQA validation set for which we have age annotations (how old a human needs to be to answer the question correctly). To estimate the degree of commonsense, we compute a weighted average of the average degree of commonsense per question, weighted by the accuracy of the model\u2019s predicted answer for that question, on the subset of questions in the VQA validation set for which we have commonsense annotations (whether the question requires commonsense to answer it).\nAPPENDIX VI: ABSTRACT SCENES DATASET In Fig. 23 (left), we show a subset of the objects that are present in the abstract scenes dataset. For more examples of the scenes generated, please see Fig. 28. The user interface used to create the scenes is shown in Fig. 23 (right). Subjects used a drag-and-drop interface to create the scenes. Each object could be flipped horizontally and scaled. The scale of the object determined the rendering order of the objects. Many objects have different attributes corresponding to different poses or types. Most animals have five different discrete poses. Humans have eight discrete expressions and their poses may be continuously adjusted using a \u201cpaperdoll\u201d model [1].\nAPPENDIX VII: USER INTERFACES In Fig. 24, we show the AMT interface that we used to collect questions for images. Note that we tell the workers that the robot already knows the answer to the previously asked question(s), inspiring them to ask different kinds of questions, thereby increasing the diversity of our dataset. Fig. 25 shows the AMT interface used for collecting answers to the previously collected questions when subjects were shown the corresponding images. Fig. 26 shows the interface that was used to collect answers to questions when subjects were not shown the corresponding image (i.e., to help in gathering incorrect, but plausible, answers for the multiplechoice task and to assess how accurately the questions can be answered using common sense knowledge alone).\n16\n17\n18\n19\nAPPENDIX VIII: ANSWER DISTRIBUTION\nThe top 250 answers in our real images dataset along with their counts and percentage counts are given below.
