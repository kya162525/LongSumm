    "abstractText": "Stability is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, yet to this date it has had little bearing on the practice of recurrent neural networks. In this work, we conduct a thorough investigation of stable recurrent models. Theoretically, we prove stable recurrent neural networks are well approximated by feed-forward networks for the purpose of both inference and training by gradient descent. Empirically, we demonstrate stable recurrent models often perform as well as their unstable counterparts on benchmark sequence tasks. Taken together, these findings shed light on the effective power of recurrent networks and suggest much of sequence learning happens, or can be made to happen, in the stable regime. Moreover, our results help to explain why in many cases practitioners succeed in replacing recurrent models by feed-forward models.",

At the outset, recurrent neural networks are non-linear dynamical systems commonly trained to fit sequence data via some variant of gradient descent.\nStability is of fundamental importance in the study of dynamical system. Surprisingly, however, stability has had little impact on the practice of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent models trained in practice do not satisfy stability in an obvious manner, suggesting that perhaps training happens in a chaotic regime. The difficulty of training recurrent models has compelled practitioners to successfully replace recurrent models with non-recurrent, feed-forward architectures.\nThis state of affairs raises important unresolved questions."

In particular, not only are the models equivalent for inference, they are also equivalent for training via gradient descent. While it is easy to contrive non-linear recurrent models that on some input\n\u2217Email: miller john@berkeley.edu \u2020Email: hardt@berkeley.edu\nar X\niv :1\n80 5.\n10 36\n9v 4\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\nsequence cannot be approximated by feed-forward models, our result implies such models are inevitably unstable. This means in particular they must have exploding gradients, which is in general an impediment to learnibility via gradient descent.\nSecond, across a variety of different sequence tasks, we show how recurrent models can often be made stable without loss in performance. We also show models that are nominally unstable often operate in the stable regime on the data distribution. Combined with our first result, these observation helps to explain why an increasingly large body of empirical research succeeds in replacing recurrent models with feed-forward models in important applications, including translation [6,26], speech synthesis [25], and language modeling [5]. While stability does not always hold in practice to begin with, it is often possible to generate a high-performing stable model by imposing stability during training.\nOur results also shed light on the effective representational properties of recurrent networks trained in practice. In particular, stable models cannot have long-term memory. Therefore, when stable and unstable models achieve similar results, either the task does not require long-term memory, or the unstable model does not have it."

We present a generic definition of stable recurrent models in terms of non-linear dynamical systems and show how to ensure stability of several commonly used models. Previous work establishes stability for vanilla recurrent neural networks. We give new sufficient conditions for stability of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. These sufficient conditions come with an efficient projection operator that can be used at training time to enforce stability.\n2. We prove, under the stability assumption, feed-forward networks can approximate recurrent networks for purposes of both inference and training by gradient descent. While simple in the case of inference, the training result relies on non-trivial stability properties of gradient descent.\n3. We conduct extensive experimentation on a variety of sequence benchmarks, show stable models often have comparable performance with their unstable counterparts, and discuss when, if ever, there is an intrinsic performance price to using stable models."

From a pragmatic perspective, stability roughly corresponds to the criterion that the gradients of the training objective do not explode over time.

To study stable variants of common architectures, we give sufficient conditions to ensure stability and describe how to efficiently enforce these conditions during training."

The hidden state ht \u2208 Rn evolves in discrete time\nsteps according to the update rule\nht = \u03c6w(ht\u22121, xt) , (1)\nwhere the vector xt \u2208 Rd is an arbitrary input provided to the system at time t. This general formulation allows us to unify many examples of interest. For instance, for a recurrent neural network, given weight matrices W and U , the state evolves according to\nht = \u03c6W,U (ht\u22121, xt) = tanh (Wht\u22121 + Uxt) .\nRecurrent models are typically trained using some variant of gradient descent. One natural\u2014 even if not strictly necessary\u2014requirement for gradient descent to work is that the gradients of the training objective do not explode over time. Stable recurrent models are precisely the class of models where the gradients cannot explode. They thus constitute a natural class of models where gradient descent can be expected to work. In general, we define a stable recurrent model as follows.\nDefinition 1. A recurrent model \u03c6w is stable if there exists some \u03bb < 1 such that, for any weights w \u2208 Rm, states h, h\u2032 \u2208 Rn, and input x \u2208 Rd,\u2225\u2225\u03c6w(h, x)\u2212 \u03c6w(h\u2032, x)\u2225\u2225 \u2264 \u03bb \u2225\u2225h\u2212 h\u2032\u2225\u2225 . (2)\nEquivalently, a recurrent model is stable if the map \u03c6w is \u03bb-contractive in h. If \u03c6w is \u03bb-stable, then \u2016\u2207h\u03c6w(h, x)\u2016 < \u03bb, and for Lipschitz loss p, \u2016\u2207wp\u2016 is always bounded [21].\nStable models are particularly well-behaved and well-justified from a theoretical perspective. For instance, at present, only stable linear dynamical systems are known to be learnable via gradient descent [7]. In unstable models, the gradients of the objective can explode, and it is a delicate matter to even show that gradient descent converges to a stationary point. The following proposition offers one such example. The proof is provided in the appendix.\nProposition 1. There exists an unstable system \u03c6w where gradient descent does not converge to a stationary point, and \u2016\u2207wp\u2016 \u2192 \u221e as the number of iterations N \u2192\u221e."

Given a Lipschitz, point-wise non-linearity \u03c1 and matrices W \u2208 Rn\u00d7n and U \u2208 Rn\u00d7d, the state-transition map for a recurrent neural network (RNN) is\nht = \u03c1(Wht\u22121 + Uxt).\nIf \u03c1 is the identity, then the system is a linear dynamical system.

In the case of a linear dynamical system, the model is stable provided \u2016W\u2016 < 1. Similarly, for the 1-Lipschitz tanh-nonlinearity, stability obtains provided \u2016W\u2016 < 1. In the appendix, we verify the assumptions required by the theorems given in the next section for this example. Imposing this condition during training corresponds to projecting onto the spectral norm ball.\nLong short-term memory networks. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are another commonly used class of sequence models [9]. The state is a pair of vectors s = (c, h) \u2208 R2d, and the model is parameterized by eight matrices, W \u2208 Rd\u00d7d and U \u2208 Rd\u00d7n, for \u2208 {i, f, o, z}. The state-transition map \u03c6LSTM is given by\nft = \u03c3(Wfht\u22121 + Ufxt)\nit = \u03c3(Wiht\u22121 + Uixt)\not = \u03c3(Woht\u22121 + Uoxt)\nzt = tanh(Wzht\u22121 + Uzxt) ct = it \u25e6 zt + ft \u25e6 ct\u22121 ht = ot \u00b7 tanh(ct),\nwhere \u25e6 denotes elementwise multiplication, and \u03c3 is the logistic function. We provide conditions under which the iterated system \u03c6rLSTM = \u03c6LSTM \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 \u03c6LSTM is stable. Let \u2016f\u2016\u221e = supt \u2016ft\u2016\u221e. If the weights Wf , Uf and inputs xt are bounded, then \u2016f\u2016\u221e < 1 since |\u03c3| < 1 for any finite input. This means the next state ct must \u201cforget\u201d a non-trivial portion of ct\u22121. We leverage this phenomenon to give sufficient conditions for \u03c6LSTM to be contractive in the `\u221e norm, which in turn implies the iterated system \u03c6 r LSTM is contractive in the `2 norm for r = O(log(d)). Let \u2016W\u2016\u221e denote the induced `\u221e matrix norm, which corresponds to the maximum absolute row sum maxi \u2211 j |Wij |.\nProposition 2.

The conditions given in Proposition 2 are fairly restrictive. Somewhat surprisingly we show in the experiments models satisfying these stability conditions still achieve good performance on a number of tasks. We leave it as an open problem to find different parameter regimes where the system is stable, as well as resolve whether the original system \u03c6LSTM is stable. Imposing these conditions during training and corresponds to simple rowwise normalization of the weight matrices and inputs. More details are provided in Section 4 and the appendix."

We show gradient descent for stable recurrent models finds essentially the same solutions as gradient descent for truncated models. Consequently, both the recurrent and truncated models found by gradient descent make essentially the same predictions.\nOur proof technique is to initialize both the recurrent and truncated models at the same point and track the divergence in weights throughout the course of gradient descent. Roughly, we show\nif k \u2248 O(log(N/\u03b5)), then after N steps of gradient descent, the difference in the weights between the recurrent and truncated models is at most \u03b5. Even if the gradients are similar for both models at the same point, it is a priori possible that slight differences in the gradients accumulate over time and lead to divergent weights where no meaningful comparison is possible. Building on similar techniques as [8], we show that gradient descent itself is stable, and this type of divergence cannot occur.\nOur gradient descent result requires two essential lemmas. The first bounds the difference in gradient between the full and the truncated model. The second establishes the gradient map of both the full and truncated models is Lipschitz. We defer proofs of both lemmas to the appendix.\nLet pT denote the loss function evaluated on recurrent model after T time steps, and define p k T similarly for the truncated model.

At initialization, w0recurr = w 0 trunc. For k sufficiently large, Lemma 2 guarantees the difference between the gradient of the recurrent and truncated models is negligible. Therefore, after a gradient update,\n\u2225\u2225w1recurr \u2212 w1trunc\u2225\u2225 is small. Lemma 3 then guarantees that this small difference in weights does not lead to large differences in the gradient on the subsequent time step.

The decaying step size in our theorem is consistent with the regime in which gradient descent is known to be stable for non-convex training objectives [8]. While the decay is faster than many learning rates encountered in practice, classical results nonetheless show that with this learning rate gradient descent still converges to a stationary point; see p. 119 in [4] and references there. In the appendix, we give empirical evidence the O(1/t) rate is necessary for our theorem and show examples of stable systems trained with constant or O(1/ \u221a t) rates that do not satisfy our bound.\nCritically, the bound in Proposition 4 goes to 0 as k \u2192\u221e.

To increase the coverage of our experiments, we train and evaluate the word-level language models on the Wikitext-2 dataset, which is twice as large as Penn Treebank and features a larger vocabulary [17]. Performance is reported using bits-per-character for character-level models and perplexity for word-level models.\nPolyphonic music modeling.

If we measure stability in a data-dependent fashion, then the unstable LSTM language models are stable, indicating this gap is illusory. However, in some cases with short sequences, instability can offer modeling benefits.\nLSTM language models are stable in a \u201cdata-dependent\u201d way. Our notion of stability is conservative and requires stability to hold for every input and pair of hidden states. If we instead consider a weaker, data-dependent notion of stability, the word and character-level LSTM models are stable (in the iterated sense of Proposition 2). In particular, we compute the stability parameter only using input sequences from the data. Furthermore, we only evaluate stability on hidden states reachable via gradient descent. More precisely, to estimate \u03bb, we run gradient ascent to find worst-case hidden states h, h\u2032 to maximize \u2016\u03c6w(h,x)\u2212\u03c6w(h \u2032,x)\u2016\n\u2016h\u2212h\u2032\u2016 . More details are provided in the appendix.\nThe data-dependent definition given above is a useful diagnostic\u2014 when the sufficient stability conditions fail to hold, the data-dependent condition addresses whether the model is still operating in the stable regime. Moreover, when the input representation is fixed during training, our theoretical results go through without modification when using the data-dependent definition.\nUsing the data-dependent measure, in Figure 2(a), we show the iterated character-level LSTM, \u03c6rLSTM, is stable for r \u2248 80 iterations. A similar result holds for the word-level language model for r \u2248 100. These findings are consistent with experiments in [14] which find LSTM trajectories converge after approximately 70 steps only when evaluated on sequences from the data. For language models, the \u201cprice of stability\u201d is therefore much smaller than the gap in Table 1 suggests\u2013 even the \u201cunstable\u201d models are operating in the stable regime on the data distribution.\nUnstable systems can offer performance improvements for short-time horizons. When sequences are short, training unstable models is less difficult because exploding gradients are less of an issue. In these case, unstable models can offer performance gains. To demonstrate this, we train truncated unstable models on the polyphonic music task for various values of the truncation parameter k. In Figure 2(b), we simultaneously plot the performance of the unstable model and the stability parameter \u03bb for the converged model for each k. For short-sequences, the final model is more unstable (\u03bb \u2248 3.5) and achieves a better test-likelihood. For longer sequence lengths, \u03bb decreases closer to the stable regime (\u03bb \u2248 1.5), and this improved test-likelihood performance disappears."

In this section, we offer further evidence unstable models are operating in the stable regime. These results further help explain why stable and unstable models perform comparably in experiments.\nVanishing gradients. Stable models necessarily have vanishing gradients, and indeed this ingredient is a key ingredient in the proof of our training-time approximation result. For both word and character-level language models, we find both unstable RNNs and LSTMs also exhibit vanishing gradients. In Figures 3(a) and 3(b), we plot the average gradient of the loss at time t+i with respect to the input at time t, \u2016\u2207xtpt+i\u2016 as t ranges over the training set. For either language modeling task, the LSTM and the RNN suffer from limited sensitivity to distant inputs at initialization and throughout training. The gradients of the LSTM vanish more slowly than those of the RNN, but both models exhibit the same qualitative behavior.\nTruncating Unstable Models. The results in Section 3 show stable models can be truncated without loss of performance. In practice, unstable models can also be truncated without performance loss. In Figures 4(a) and 4(b), we show the performance of both LSTMs and RNNs for various values of the truncation parameter k on word-level language modeling and polyphonic music modeling. Initially, increasing k increases performance because the model can use more context to make predictions. However, in both cases, there is diminishing returns to larger values of the truncation parameter k. LSTMs are unaffected by longer truncation lengths, whereas the performance of RNNs slightly degrades as k becomes very large, possibly due to training instability. In either case, diminishing returns to performance for large values of k means truncation and therefore feed-forward approximation is possible even for these unstable models.\nProposition (4) holds for unstable models. In stable models, Proposition (4) in Section 3 ensures the distance between the weight matrices \u2016wrecurr \u2212 wtrunc\u2016 grows slowly as training progresses, and this rate decreases as k becomes large. In Figures 5(a) and 5(b), we show a similar result holds empirically for unstable word-level language models.

As suggested by Proposition (4), after an initial rapid increase in distance, \u2016Wk \u2212W65\u2016 grows slowly, as suggested by Proposition 4.

[7] show gradient descent can efficiently learn a class of stable, linear dynamical systems, [20] shows gradient descent learns a class of stable, non-linear dynamical systems. Work by [23] gives a moment-based approach for learning some classes of stable non-linear recurrent neural networks. Our work explores the theoretical and empirical consequences of the stability assumption made in these works. In particular, our empirical results show models trained in practice can be made closer to those currently being analyzed theoretically without large performance penalties.\nFor linear dynamical systems, [24] exploit the connection between stability and truncation to learn a truncated approximation to the full stable system. Their approximation result is the same as our inference result for linear dynamical systems, and we extend this result to the non-linear setting. We also analyze the impact of truncation on training with gradient descent. Our training time analysis builds on the stability analysis of gradient descent in [8], but interestingly uses it for an entirely different purpose. Results of this kind are completely new to our knowledge.\nFor RNNs, the link between vanishing and exploding gradients and \u2016W\u2016 was identified in [21]. For 1-layer RNNs, [10] give sufficient conditions for stability in terms of the norm \u2016W\u2016 and the Lipschitz constant of the non-linearity. Our work additionally considers LSTMs and provides new\nsufficient conditions for stability. Moreover, we study the consequences of stability in terms of feed-forward approximation.\nA number of recent works have sought to avoid vanishing and exploding gradients by ensuring the system is an isometry, i.e. \u03bb = 1. In the RNN case, this amounts to constraining \u2016W\u2016 = 1 [2,11,12,19,28]. [27] observes strictly requiring \u2016W\u2016 = 1 reduces performance on several tasks, and instead proposes maintaining \u2016W\u2016 \u2208 [1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1 + \u03b5]. [29] maintains this \u201csoft-isometry\u201d constraint using a parameterization based on the SVD that obviates the need for the projection step used in our stable-RNN experiments. [13] sidestep these issues and stabilizes training using a residual parameterization of the model. At present, these unitary models have not yet seen widespread use, and our work shows much of the sequence learning in practice, even with nominally unstable models, actually occurs in the stable regime.\nFrom an empirical perspective, [14] introduce a non-chaotic recurrent architecture and demonstrate it can perform as well more complex models like LSTMs. [3] conduct a detailed evaluation of recurrent and convolutional, feed-forward models on a variety of sequence modeling tasks. In diverse settings, they find feed-forward models outperform their recurrent counterparts. Their experiments are complimentary to ours; we find recurrent models can often be replaced with stable recurrent models, which we show are equivalent to feed-forward networks."

Consider a scalar linear dynamical system\nht = aht\u22121 + bxt (4)\ny\u0302t = ht, (5)\nwhere h0 = 0, a, b \u2208 R are parameters, and xt, yt \u2208 R are elements the input-output sequence {(xt, yt)}Tt=1, where L is the sequence length, and y\u0302t is the prediction at time t.

For sufficiently large k (independent of the sequence length), the impact of truncation is therefore negligible. The proof leverages the \u201cvanishing-gradient\u201d phenomenon\u2013 the long-term components of the gradient of the full recurrent model quickly vanish. The remaining challenge is to show the short-term components of the gradient are similar for the full and recurrent models.\nProof of Lemma 2. The Jacobian of the loss with respect to the weights is\n\u2202pT \u2202w = \u2202pT \u2202hT ( T\u2211 t=0 \u2202hT \u2202ht \u2202ht \u2202w ) ,\nwhere \u2202ht\u2202w is the partial derivative of ht with respect to w, assuming ht\u22121 is constant with respect to w.

The first term consists of the \u201clong-term components\u201d of the gradient for the recurrent model.

First, we show on the forward pass, the difference between hidden states ht(w) and h \u2032 t(w \u2032) obtained by running the model with weights w and w\u2032, respectively, is bounded in terms of \u2016w \u2212 w\u2032\u2016. Using smoothness of \u03c6, the difference in gradients can be written in terms of \u2016ht(w)\u2212 h\u2032t(w\u2032)\u2016, which in turn can be bounded in terms of \u2016w \u2212 w\u2032\u2016. We repeatedly leverage this fact to conclude the total difference in gradients must be similarly bounded.\nWe first show small differences in weights don\u2019t significantly change the trajectory of the recurrent model.\nLemma 5. For some w,w\u2032, suppose \u03c6w, \u03c6w\u2032 are \u03bb-contractive and Lw Lipschitz in w. Let ht(w), ht(w \u2032) be the hidden state at time t obtain from running the model with weights w,w\u2032 on common inputs {xt}.

The key result underlying Theorem 1 is the bound on the parameter difference \u2016wtrunc \u2212 wrecurr\u2016 while running gradient descent obtained in Proposition 4. We show this bound has the correct qualitative scaling using random instances and training\nrandomly initialized, stable linear dynamical systems and tanh-RNNs. In Figure 6, we plot the parameter error \u2225\u2225wttrunc \u2212 wtrecurr\u2225\u2225 as training progresses for both models (averaged over 10 runs). The error scales comparably with the bound given in Proposition 4. We also find for larger step-sizes like \u03b1/ \u221a t or constant \u03b1, the bound fails to hold, suggesting the O(1/t) condition is necessary.\nConcretely, we generate random problem instance by fixing a sequence length T = 200, sampling input data xt i.i.d.\u223c N (0, 4 \u00b7 I32), and sampling yT \u223c Unif[\u22122, 2]. Next, we set \u03bb = 0.75 and randomly initialize a stable linear dynamical system or RNN with tanh non-linearity by sampling Uij ,Wij i.i.d.\u223c N (0, 0.5) and thresholding the singular values of W so \u2016W\u2016 \u2264 \u03bb. We use the squared loss and prediction function f(ht, xt) = Cht+Dxt, where C,D i.i.d.\u223c N (0, I32). We fix the truncation length to k = 35, set the learning rate to \u03b1t = \u03b1/t for \u03b1 = 0.01, and take N = 200 gradient steps. These parameters are chosen so that the \u03b3k\u03bbkN\u03b1\u03b2+1 bound from Proposition 4 does not become vacuous \u2013 by triangle inequality, we always have \u2016wtrunc \u2212 wrecurr\u2016 \u2264 2\u03bb.\nStable vs. unstable models. The word and character level language modeling experiments are based on publically available code from [16]. The polyphonic music modeling code is based on the code in [3], and the slot-filling model is a reimplementation of [18] 1\nSince the sufficient conditions for stability derived in Section 2.2 only apply for networks with a single layer, we use a single layer RNN or LSTM for all experiments. Further, our theoretical results are only applicable for vanilla SGD, and not adaptive gradient methods, so all models are trained with SGD. Table 2 contains a summary of all the hyperparameters for each experiment.\nAll hyperparameters are shared between the stable and unstable variants of both models. In the RNN case, enforcing stability is conceptually simple, though computationally expensive. Since tanh is 1-Lipschitz, the RNN is stable as long as \u2016W\u2016 < 1. Therefore, after each gradient update, we project W onto the spectral norm ball by taking the SVD and thresholding the singular values to lie in [0, 1). In the LSTM case, enforcing stability is conceptually more difficult, but computationally\n1The word-level language modeling code is based on https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_ language_model, the character-level code is based on https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm, and the polyphonic music modeling code is based on https://github.com/locuslab/TCN.\nsimple. To ensure the LSTM is stable, we appeal to Proposition 2. We enforce the following inequalities after each gradient update\n1. The hidden-to-hidden forget gate matrix should satisfy \u2016Wf\u2016\u221e < 0.128, which is enforced by normalizing the `1- norm of each row to have value at most 0.128.\n2. The input vectors xt must satisfy \u2016xt\u2016\u221e \u2264 Bx = 0.75, which is achieved by thresholding all values to lie in [\u22120.75, 0.75].\n3. The bias of the forget gate bf , must satsify \u2016bf\u2016\u221e \u2264 0.25, which is again achieved by thresholding all values to lie in [\u22120.25, 0.25].\n4. The input-hidden forget gate matrix Uf should satisfy \u2016Uf\u2016\u221e \u2264 0.25. This is enforced by normalizing the `1- norm of each row to have value at most 0.25.\n5. Given 1-4, the forget gate can take value at most f\u221e < 0.64. Consequently, we enforce \u2016Wi\u2016\u221e , \u2016Wo\u2016\u221e \u2264 0.36, \u2016Wz\u2016 \u2264 0.091, and \u2016Wf\u2016\u221e < min { 0.128, (1\u2212 0.64)2 } = 0.128.\nAfter 1-5 are enforced, by Proposition 2, the resulting (iterated)-LSTM is stable. Although the above description is somewhat complicated, the implementation boils down to normalizing the rows of the LSTM weight matrices, which can be done very efficiently in a few lines of PyTorch.\nData-dependent stability. Unlike the RNN, in an LSTM, it is not clear how to analytically compute the stability parameter \u03bb. Instead, we rely on a heuristic method to estimate \u03bb. Recall a model is stable if for all x, h, h\u2032, we have\nS(h, h\u2032, x) := \u2016\u03c6w(h, x)\u2212 \u03c6w(h\u2032, x)\u2016\n\u2016h\u2212 h\u2032\u2016 \u2264 \u03bb < 1. (7)\nTo estimate suph,h\u2032,x S(h, h \u2032, x), we do the following. First, we take x to be point in the training set. In the language modeling case, x is one of the learned word-vectors. We randomly sample and fix x, and then we perform gradient ascent on S(h, h\u2032, x) to find worst-case h, h\u2032. In our experiments, we initialize h, h\u2032 \u223c N (0, 0.1 \u00b7 I) and run gradient ascent with learning rate 0.9 for 1000 steps. This procedure is repeated 20 times, and we estimate \u03bb as the maximum value of S(h, h\u2032, x) encounted during any iteration from any of the 20 random starting points."
