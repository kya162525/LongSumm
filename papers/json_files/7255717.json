    "abstractText": "Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing textto-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256\u00d7256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.",

Conditioned on given text descriptions, conditional-\nGANs [26, 24] are able to generate images that are highly related to the text meanings.\nHowever, it is very difficult to train GAN to generate high-resolution photo-realistic images from text descriptions. Simply adding more upsampling layers in state-ofthe-art GAN models for generating high-resolution (e.g., 256\u00d7256) images generally results in training instability\n1\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n03 24\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 5\nA ug\nand produces nonsensical outputs (see Figure 1(c)). The main difficulty for generating high-resolution images by GANs is that supports of natural image distribution and implied model distribution may not overlap in high dimensional pixel space [31, 1]. This problem is more severe as the image resolution increases. Reed et al. only succeeded in generating plausible 64\u00d764 images conditioned on text descriptions [26], which usually lack details and vivid object parts, e.g., beaks and eyes of birds. Moreover, they were unable to synthesize higher resolution (e.g., 128\u00d7128) images without providing additional annotations of objects [24].\nIn analogy to how human painters draw, we decompose the problem of text to photo-realistic image synthesis into two more tractable sub-problems with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN). Low-resolution images are first generated by our Stage-I GAN (see Figure 1(a)). On the top of our Stage-I GAN, we stack Stage-II GAN to generate realistic high-resolution (e.g., 256\u00d7256) images conditioned on Stage-I results and text descriptions (see Figure 1(b)). By conditioning on the Stage-I result and the text again, Stage-II GAN learns to capture the text information that is omitted by Stage-I GAN and draws more details for the object. The support of model distribution generated from a roughly aligned low-resolution image has better probability of intersecting with the support of image distribution. This is the underlying reason why Stage-II GAN is able to generate better high-resolution images.\nIn addition, for the text-to-image generation task, the limited number of training text-image pairs often results in sparsity in the text conditioning manifold and such sparsity makes it difficult to train GAN. Thus, we propose a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique to encourage smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. It allows small random perturbations in the conditioning manifold and increases the diversity of synthesized images.\nThe contribution of the proposed method is threefold: (1) We propose a novel Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks for synthesizing photo-realistic images from text descriptions. It decomposes the difficult problem of generating high-resolution images into more manageable subproblems and significantly improve the state of the art. The StackGAN for the first time generates images of 256\u00d7256 resolution with photo-realistic details from text descriptions. (2) A new Conditioning Augmentation technique is proposed to stabilize the conditional GAN training and also improves the diversity of the generated samples. (3) Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall model design as well as the effects of individual components, which provide useful information for designing future conditional GAN models. Our code is available at https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN."

            "text": "Generative image modeling is a fundamental problem in computer vision. There has been remarkable progress in this direction with the emergence of deep learning techniques. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) [13, 28] formulated the problem with probabilistic graphical models whose goal was to maximize the lower bound of data likelihood. Autoregressive models (e.g., PixelRNN) [33] that utilized neural networks to model the conditional distribution of the pixel space have also generated appealing synthetic images. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [8] have shown promising performance for generating sharper images. But training instability makes it hard for GAN models to generate high-resolution (e.g., 256\u00d7256) images. Several techniques [23, 29, 18, 1, 3] have been proposed to stabilize the training process and generate compelling results. An energy-based GAN [38] has also been proposed for more stable training behavior.\nBuilt upon these generative models, conditional image generation has also been studied. Most methods utilized simple conditioning variables such as attributes or class labels [37, 34, 4, 22]. There is also work conditioned on images to generate images, including photo editing [2, 39], domain transfer [32, 12] and super-resolution [31, 15]. However, super-resolution methods [31, 15] can only add limited details to low-resolution images and can not correct large defects as our proposed StackGAN does. Recently, several methods have been developed to generate images from unstructured text. Mansimov et al. [17] built an AlignDRAW model by learning to estimate alignment between text and the generating canvas. Reed et al. [27] used conditional PixelCNN to generate images using the text descriptions and object location constraints. Nguyen et al. [20] used an approximate Langevin sampling approach to generate images conditioned on text. However, their sampling approach requires an inefficient iterative optimization process. With conditional GAN, Reed et al. [26] successfully generated plausible 64\u00d764 images for birds and flowers based on text descriptions. Their follow-up work [24] was able to generate 128\u00d7128 images by utilizing additional annotations on object part locations.\nBesides using a single GAN for generating images, there is also work [36, 5, 10] that utilized a series of GANs for image generation. Wang et al. [36] factorized the indoor scene generation process into structure generation and style generation with the proposed S2-GAN. In contrast, the second stage of our StackGAN aims to complete object details and correct defects of Stage-I results based on text descriptions. Denton et al. [5] built a series of GANs within a Laplacian pyramid framework. At each level of the pyramid, a residual image was generated conditioned on the image of the previous stage and then added back to the input image to produce the input for the next stage. Concurrent to our\nwork, Huang et al. [10] also showed that they can generate better images by stacking several GANs to reconstruct the multi-level representations of a pre-trained discriminative model. However, they only succeeded in generating 32\u00d732 images, while our method utilizes a simpler architecture to generate 256\u00d7256 images with photo-realistic details and sixty-four times more pixels."

            "text": "As shown in Figure 2, the text description t is first encoded by an encoder, yielding a text embedding \u03d5t. In previous works [26, 24], the text embedding is nonlinearly transformed to generate conditioning latent variables as the input of the generator. However, latent space for the text embedding is usually high dimensional (> 100 dimensions). With limited amount of data, it usually causes discontinuity in the latent data manifold, which is not desirable\nfor learning the generator. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a Conditioning Augmentation technique to produce additional conditioning variables c\u0302. In contrast to the fixed conditioning text variable c in [26, 24], we randomly sample the latent variables c\u0302 from an independent Gaussian distribution N (\u00b5(\u03d5t),\u03a3(\u03d5t)), where the mean \u00b5(\u03d5t) and diagonal covariance matrix \u03a3(\u03d5t) are functions of the text embedding \u03d5t. The proposed Conditioning Augmentation yields more training pairs given a small number of imagetext pairs, and thus encourages robustness to small perturbations along the conditioning manifold. To further enforce the smoothness over the conditioning manifold and avoid overfitting [6, 14], we add the following regularization term to the objective of the generator during training,\nDKL(N (\u00b5(\u03d5t),\u03a3(\u03d5t)) || N (0, I)), (2)\nwhich is the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between the standard Gaussian distribution and the conditioning Gaussian distribution. The randomness introduced in the Conditioning Augmentation is beneficial for modeling text to image translation as the same sentence usually corresponds to objects with various poses and appearances."

            "text": "Instead of directly generating a high-resolution image conditioned on the text description, we simplify the task to first generate a low-resolution image with our Stage-I GAN, which focuses on drawing only rough shape and correct colors for the object.\nLet \u03d5t be the text embedding of the given description, which is generated by a pre-trained encoder [25] in this paper. The Gaussian conditioning variables c\u03020 for text embedding are sampled from N (\u00b50(\u03d5t),\u03a30(\u03d5t)) to capture the meaning of \u03d5t with variations.

Using the reparameterization trick introduced in [13], both \u00b50(\u03d5t) and \u03a30(\u03d5t) are learned jointly with the rest of the network.\nModel Architecture. For the generator G0, to obtain text conditioning variable c\u03020, the text embedding \u03d5t is first\nfed into a fully connected layer to generate \u00b50 and \u03c30 (\u03c30 are the values in the diagonal of \u03a30) for the Gaussian distribution N (\u00b50(\u03d5t),\u03a30(\u03d5t)). c\u03020 are then sampled from the Gaussian distribution. Our Ng dimensional conditioning vector c\u03020 is computed by c\u03020 = \u00b50 + \u03c30 (where is the element-wise multiplication, \u223c N (0, I)). Then, c\u03020 is concatenated with a Nz dimensional noise vector to generate a W0 \u00d7H0 image by a series of up-sampling blocks.\nFor the discriminator D0, the text embedding \u03d5t is first compressed toNd dimensions using a fully-connected layer and then spatially replicated to form a Md \u00d7 Md \u00d7 Nd tensor. Meanwhile, the image is fed through a series of down-sampling blocks until it has Md \u00d7Md spatial dimension. Then, the image filter map is concatenated along the channel dimension with the text tensor. The resulting tensor is further fed to a 1\u00d71 convolutional layer to jointly learn features across the image and the text. Finally, a fullyconnected layer with one node is used to produce the decision score."

Some details in the text might also be omitted in the first stage, which is vital for generating photo-realistic images. Our Stage-II GAN is built upon Stage-I GAN results to generate high-resolution images. It is conditioned on low-resolution images and also the text embedding again to correct defects in Stage-I results. The Stage-II GAN completes previously ignored text information to generate more photo-realistic details.\nConditioning on the low-resolution result s0 = G0(z, c\u03020) and Gaussian latent variables c\u0302, the discriminator\nD and generator G in Stage-II GAN are trained by alternatively maximizing LD in Eq.

Gaussian conditioning variables c\u0302 used in this stage and c\u03020 used in Stage-I GAN share the same pre-trained text encoder, generating the same text embedding \u03d5t. However, StageI and Stage-II Conditioning Augmentation have different fully connected layers for generating different means and standard deviations. In this way, Stage-II GAN learns to capture useful information in the text embedding that is omitted by Stage-I GAN.\nModel Architecture. We design Stage-II generator as an encoder-decoder network with residual blocks [9]. Similar to the previous stage, the text embedding \u03d5t is used to generate the Ng dimensional text conditioning vector c\u0302, which is spatially replicated to form aMg\u00d7Mg\u00d7Ng tensor. Meanwhile, the Stage-I result s0 generated by Stage-I GAN is fed into several down-sampling blocks (i.e., encoder) until it has a spatial size of Mg \u00d7 Mg . The image features and the text features are concatenated along the channel dimension. The encoded image features coupled with text features are fed into several residual blocks, which are designed to learn multi-modal representations across image and text features. Finally, a series of up-sampling layers\n(i.e., decoder) are used to generate aW\u00d7H high-resolution image. Such a generator is able to help rectify defects in the input image while add more details to generate the realistic high-resolution image.\nFor the discriminator, its structure is similar to that of Stage-I discriminator with only extra down-sampling blocks since the image size is larger in this stage. To explicitly enforce GAN to learn better alignment between the image and the conditioning text, rather than using the vanilla discriminator, we adopt the matching-aware discriminator proposed by Reed et al. [26] for both stages. During training, the discriminator takes real images and their corresponding text descriptions as positive sample pairs, whereas negative sample pairs consist of two groups. The first is real images with mismatched text embeddings, while the second is synthetic images with their corresponding text embeddings."

Since 80% of birds in this dataset have object-image size ratios of less than 0.5 [35], as a pre-processing step, we crop all images to ensure that bounding boxes of birds have greater-than-0.75 object-image size ratios. Oxford-102 [21] contains 8,189 images of flowers from 102 different categories. To show the generalization capability of our approach, a more challenging dataset, MS COCO [16] is also utilized for evaluation. Different from CUB and Oxford102, the MS COCO dataset contains images with multiple objects and various backgrounds. It has a training set with 80k images and a validation set with 40k images. Each image in COCO has 5 descriptions, while 10 descriptions are provided by [25] for every image in CUB and Oxford102 datasets. Following the experimental setup in [26], we directly use the training and validation sets provided by COCO, meanwhile we split CUB and Oxford-102 into class-disjoint training and test sets.\nEvaluation metrics. It is difficult to evaluate the performance of generative models (e.g., GAN). We choose a recently proposed numerical assessment approach \u201cinception score\u201d [29] for quantitative evaluation,\nI = exp(ExDKL(p(y|x) || p(y))), (7)\nwhere x denotes one generated sample, and y is the label predicted by the Inception model [30]. The intuition behind this metric is that good models should generate diverse but meaningful images. Therefore, the KL divergence between the marginal distribution p(y) and the conditional distribution p(y|x) should be large. In our experiments, we directly use the pre-trained Inception model for COCO dataset. For fine-grained datasets, CUB and Oxford-102, we fine-tune an Inception model for each of them. As suggested in [29], we evaluate this metric on a large number of samples (i.e., 30k randomly selected samples) for each model.\nAlthough the inception score has shown to well correlate with human perception on visual quality of samples [29], it cannot reflect whether the generated images are well conditioned on the given text descriptions. Therefore, we also conduct human evaluation. We randomly select 50 text descriptions for each class of CUB and Oxford-102 test sets. For COCO dataset, 4k text descriptions are randomly selected from its validation set. For each sentence, 5 images are generated by each model. Given the same text descriptions, 10 users (not including any of the authors) are asked to rank the results by different methods.

As shown in the second row, StageII GAN generates 4\u00d7 higher resolution images with more convincing details to better reflect corresponding text descriptions. For cases where Stage-I GAN has generated plausible shapes and colors, Stage-II GAN completes the details. For instance, in the 1st column of Figure 5, with a satisfactory Stage-I result, Stage-II GAN focuses on draw-\ning the short beak and white color described in the text as well as details for the tail and legs. In all other examples, different degrees of details are added to Stage-II images. In many other cases, Stage-II GAN is able to correct the defects of Stage-I results by processing the text description again. For example, while the Stage-I image in the 5th column has a blue crown rather than the reddish brown crown described in the text, the defect is corrected by Stage-II GAN. In some extreme cases (e.g., the 7th column of Figure 5), even when Stage-I GAN fails to draw a plausible shape, Stage-II GAN is able to generate reasonable objects. We also observe that StackGAN has the ability to transfer background from Stage-I images and fine-tune them to be more realistic with higher resolution at Stage-II.\nImportantly, the StackGAN does not achieve good results by simply memorizing training samples but by capturing the complex underlying language-image relations. We extract visual features from our generated images and all training images by the Stage-II discriminator D of our StackGAN. For each generated image, its nearest neighbors from the training set can be retrieved. By visually inspecting the retrieved images (see Figure 6), we can conclude that the generated images have some similar characteristics with the training samples but are essentially different."

            "text": "In this subsection, we analyze different components of StackGAN on CUB dataset with our baseline models. The inception scores for those baselines are reported in Table 2.\nThe design of StackGAN. As shown in the first four rows of Table 2, if Stage-I GAN is directly used to generate images, the inception scores decrease significantly. Such performance drop can be well illustrated by results in Figure 7. As shown in the first row of Figure 7, Stage-I GAN fails to generate any plausible 256\u00d7256 samples without\nA small bird with a black head and wings and features grey wings\n256x256 Stage-I GAN without CA\n256x256 Stage-I GAN\nwith CA\n256x256 StackGAN with CA, Text twice\nThis bird is completely red with black wings and pointy beak\nFigure 7. Conditioning Augmentation (CA) helps stabilize the training of conditional GAN and improves the diversity of the generated samples. (Row 1) without CA, Stage-I GAN fails to generate plausible 256\u00d7256 samples. Although different noise vector z is used for each column, the generated samples collapse to be the same for each input text description. (Row 2-3) with CA but fixing the noise vectors z, methods are still able to generate birds with different poses and viewpoints.\nMethod CA Text twice Inception score 64\u00d764 Stage-I GAN no / 2.66 \u00b1 .03\nyes / 2.95 \u00b1 .02\n256\u00d7256 Stage-I GAN no / 2.48 \u00b1 .00yes / 3.02 \u00b1 .01\n128\u00d7128 StackGAN yes no 3.13 \u00b1 .03 no yes 3.20 \u00b1 .03 yes yes 3.35 \u00b1 .02 256\u00d7256 StackGAN yes no 3.45 \u00b1 .02 no yes 3.31 \u00b1 .03 yes yes 3.70 \u00b1 .04\nTable 2. Inception scores calculated with 30,000 samples generated by different baseline models of our StackGAN.\nusing Conditioning Augmentation (CA). Although Stage-I GAN with CA is able to generate more diverse 256\u00d7256 samples, those samples are not as realistic as samples generated by StackGAN. It demonstrates the necessity of the proposed stacked structure. In addition, by decreasing the output resolution from 256\u00d7256 to 128\u00d7128, the inception score decreases from 3.70 to 3.35. Note that all images are scaled to 299 \u00d7 299 before calculating the inception score. Thus, if our StackGAN just increases the image size without adding more information, the inception score would remain the same for samples of different resolutions. Therefore, the decrease in inception score by 128\u00d7128 StackGAN demonstrates that our 256\u00d7256 StackGAN does add more details into the larger images. For the 256\u00d7256 StackGAN, if the text is only input to Stage-I (denoted as \u201cno Text twice\u201d), the inception score decreases from 3.70 to 3.45. It indicates that processing text descriptions again at Stage-II helps refine Stage-I results. The same conclusion can be drawn from the results of 128\u00d7128 StackGAN models.\nConditioning Augmentation. We also investigate the efficacy of the proposed Conditioning Augmentation (CA). By removing it from StackGAN 256\u00d7256 (denoted as \u201cno CA\u201d in Table 2), the inception score decreases from 3.70 to 3.31. Figure 7 also shows that 256\u00d7256 Stage-I GAN (and StackGAN) with CA can generate birds with different poses\nThe bird is completely red \u2192 The bird is completely yellow\nand viewpoints from the same text embedding. In contrast, without using CA, samples generated by 256\u00d7256 StageI GAN collapse to nonsensical images due to the unstable training dynamics of GANs. Consequently, the proposed Conditioning Augmentation helps stabilize the conditional GAN training and improves the diversity of the generated samples because of its ability to encourage robustness to small perturbations along the latent manifold.\nSentence embedding interpolation. To further demonstrate that our StackGAN learns a smooth latent data manifold, we use it to generate images from linearly interpolated sentence embeddings, as shown in Figure 8. We fix the noise vector z, so the generated image is inferred from the given text description only. Images in the first row are generated by simple sentences made up by us. Those sentences contain only simple color descriptions. The results show that the generated images from interpolated embeddings can accurately reflect color changes and generate plausible bird shapes. The second row illustrates samples generated from more complex sentences, which contain more details on bird appearances. The generated images change their primary color from red to blue, and change the wing color from black to brown."

            "text": "In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) with Conditioning Augmentation for synthesizing photo-realistic images. The proposed method decomposes the text-to-image synthesis to a novel sketch-refinement process. Stage-I GAN sketches the object following basic color and shape constraints from given text descriptions. Stage-II GAN corrects the defects in Stage-I results and adds more details, yielding higher resolution images with better image quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared to existing text-to-image generative models, our method generates higher resolution images (e.g., 256\u00d7256) with more photo-realistic details and diversity."
