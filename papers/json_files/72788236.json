    "abstractText": "Tuning hyperparameters of learning algorithms is hard because gradients are usually unavailable. We compute exact gradients of cross-validation performance with respect to all hyperparameters by chaining derivatives backwards through the entire training procedure. These gradients allow us to optimize thousands of hyperparameters, including step-size and momentum schedules, weight initialization distributions, richly parameterized regularization schemes, and neural network architectures. We compute hyperparameter gradients by exactly reversing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent with momentum.",

Choosing the best hyperparameters is both crucial and frustratingly difficult.\nThe current gold standard for hyperparameter selection is gradient-free model-based optimization (Snoek et al., 2012; Bergstra et al., 2011; 2013; Hutter et al., 2011). Hyperparameters are chosen to optimize the validation loss after complete training of the model parameters. These approaches have demonstrated that automatic tuning of hyperparameters can yield state-of-the-art performance. However, in general they are not able to effectively optimize more than 10 to 20 hyperparameters.\nWhy not use gradients?

Instead of straining to eliminate hyperparameters from our models, we can embrace them, and richly hyperparameterize our models. Just as having a high-dimensional elementary parameterization gives a flexible model, having a high-dimensional hyperparameterization gives flexibility over model classes, regularization, and training methods. Section 3 explores these new opportunities.\n1Since this paper is about hyperparameters, we use \u201celementary\u201d to unambiguously denote the other sort of parameter, the \u201cparameter-that-is-just-a-parameter-and-not-a-hyperparameter\u201d."

The RMD method, known as \u201cbackpropagation\u201d in the deep learning community, allows the gradient of a scalar loss with respect to its parameters to be computed in a single backward pass. This increases the computational burden by only a factor of two over evaluating the loss itself, regardless of the number of parameters. Obtaining the same sort of information by either forwardmode differentiation or brute force finite differences would require a separate pass for each parameter and would make deep learning entirely infeasible.\nApplying RMD to hyperparameter optimization was proposed by Bengio (2000) and Baydin & Pearlmutter (2014), and applied to small problems by Domke (2012). However, the na\u0131\u0308ve approach fails for real-sized problems because of memory constraints. RMD requires that intermediate variables be maintained in memory for the reverse pass. Evaluating the validation loss requires training the model, which may require many elementary iterations. Conventional RMD stores this entire training trajectory, w1...wT in memory. In large neural networks, the amount of memory required to store the millions of parameters being trained is typically close to the amount of physical RAM available (Sutskever et al., 2014). If storing the parameter vector takes\u223c1GB, and the parameter vector is updated tens of thousands of times (the number of mini batches times the number of epochs) then storing the learning history is unmanageable even with physical storage.\nImagine that we could exactly trace a training procedure backwards, starting from the trained parameter values and working back to the initial parameters. Then we could recompute the learning trajectory on the fly during the reverse pass of RMD rather than storing it in memory. This is not possible in general, but we will show that for the popular training procedure of stochastic gradient descent with momentum, we can do exactly this, storing a small number of auxiliary bits to handle finite precision arithmetic."

Every time we apply step 8 to reduce the velocity, we lose information. Assuming we are using a fixed-point representation, 2 each multiplication by \u03b3 < 1 shifts bits to the right, destroying the least significant bits. This is more than a pedantic concern. Attempting to carry out the reverse training requires repeated multiplication by 1/\u03b3. Errors accumulate exponentially, and the reversed learning procedure ends far from the initial point (and usually overflows). Do we need \u03b3 < 1? Unfortunately we do. \u03b3 > 1 results in unstable dynamics, and \u03b3 = 1, recovers the leapfrog integrator (Hut et al., 1995), a perfectly reversible set of dynamics, but one that does not converge.\nThis problem is quite a deep one: optimization necessarily discards information. Ideally, optimization maps all initializations to the same optimum, a many-to-one mapping with no hope of inversion. Put another way, optimization moves a system from a high-entropy initial state to a low-entropy (hopefully zero entropy) optimized final state.\nIt is interesting to consider the analogy with physical dynamics. The \u03b3 term is analogous to a drag term in the simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics. Having \u03b3 < 1 corresponds to dissipative dynamics which generates heat, increases the entropy of the environment and is not therefore not reversible. But we must have dissipation in order for our system to converge to equilibrium.\nIf we want to reverse the dynamics, there is no choice but to store the extra bits discarded by the \u03b3 operation. But we can at least try to be parsimonious about the number of extra bits we store. This is what the next section addresses."

But for fine-grained control over \u03b3 we need a way to store\n2We assume fixed-point representation to simplify the discussion (and the implementation). Courbariaux et al. (2014) show that fixed-point arithmetic is sufficient to train deep networks. Floating point representation doesn\u2019t fix the problem, it just defers the loss of information from the division step to the addition step.\nthe information lost when we multiply by, say, \u03b3 = 0.9, which will be less than one bit on average. Here we give a procedure which achieves exactly this.\nWe represent the velocity v and parameter w vectors with 64-bit integers. With an implied radix point this can be a fixed-point representation of the reals. We represent \u03b3 as a rational number, n/d. When we divide each v by d we use integer division. In order to be able to reverse the process we just need to store the remainder, v modulo s, in some \u201cinformation buffer\u201d, B. If B were an integer and n = 2, the remainder r would just be a single bit, and we could store it in B by left-shifting B\u2019s bits and adding r. For arbitrary n, we can do the base-n analogue of this operation: multiply B by n and add r. Eventually, B will overflow. We need a way to either detect this, store the bits, and start a fresh integer, or else we can just use an arbitrary size integer that grows as needed. (Python\u2019s \u201clong\u201d integer type supports this). This procedure allows division by n while storing the remainder in log2(n) bits on average.\nWhen we multiply by the numerator of n/d we don\u2019t need to store anything extra, since integer division will bring us back to exactly the same point anyway. But the procedure as it stands would store three bits when \u03b3 = 7/8, whereas it should store less than one (log2(8/7) = 0.19). Our solution is the following: when we multiply v by n, there is an opportunity to add a nonnegative integer smaller than n to the result without affecting the reverse process (integer division by n). We can get such an integer from the information buffer by dividing it by n and recording B modulo n. We are using the velocity v as an information buffer itself! Algorithm 3 illustrates the entire process.\nAlgorithm 3 Exactly reversible multiplication by a ratio 1: Input: Information buffer i, value c, ratio n/d 2: i = i\u00d7 d . make room for new digit 3: i = i+ (c mod d) . store digit lost by division 4: c = c\u00f7 d . divide by denominator 5: c = c\u00d7 n . multiply by numerator 6: c = c+ (i mod n) . add digit from buffer 7: i = i\u00f7 n . shorten information buffer 8: return updated buffer i, updated value c\nWe could also have used an arithmetic coding scheme for our information buffer (MacKay, 2003, Chapter 6). How much does this procedure save us? When \u03b3 = 0.98, we will have to store only 0.029 bits on average. Compared to storing a new 32-bit integer or floating-point number at each iteration, this reduces memory requirements by a factor of one thousand.\nThe standard way to save memory in RMD is checkpointing. Checkpointing stores the entire parameter vector on only a fraction of the training steps, and recomputes\nthe missing steps of the training procedure (forwards) as needed during the backward pass. However, this would require too much memory to be practical for large neural nets trained for thousands of minibatches."

These schedule choices are supported by a mixture of intuition, arguments about the shape of the objective function, and empirical tuning.\nTo more directly shed light on good learning rate schedules, we jointly optimized separate learning rates for every single learning iteration of training of a deep neural network, as well as separately for weights and biases in each layer. Each meta-iteration trained a network for 100 iterations of SGD, meaning that the learning rate schedules were specified by 800 hyperparameters (100 iterations \u00d7 4 layers \u00d7 2 types of parameters). To avoid learning an optimization schedule that depended on the quirks of a particular random initialization, each evaluation of hypergradients used a different random seed. These random seeds were used both to initialize network weights and to choose mini batches. The network was trained on 10,000 examples of MNIST, and had 4 layers, of sizes 784, 50, 50, and 50.\nBecause learning schedules can implicitly regularize networks (Erhan et al., 2010), for example by enforcing early stopping, for this experiment we optimized the learning rate schedules on the training error rather than on the validation set error. Figure 2 shows the results of optimizing learning rate schedules separately for each layer of a deep neural network. When Bayesian optimization was used to choose\na fixed learning rate for all layers and iterations, it chose a learning rate of 2.4.\nMeta-optimization strategies We experimented with several standard stochastic optimization methods for metaoptimization, including SGD, RMSprop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012), and minibatch conjugate gradients. The results in this section used Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), a variant of RMSprop that includes momentum. We typically ran for 50 meta-iterations, and used a meta-step size of 0.04. Figure 3 shows the elementary and meta-learning curves that generated the hyperparameters shown in Figure 2.\nHow smooth are hypergradients? To demonstrate that the hypergradients are smooth with respect to time steps in the training schedule, Figure 4 shows the hypergradient with respect to the step size training schedule at the beginning of training, averaged over 100 random seeds.\nOptimizing weight initialization scales We optimized a separate weight initialization scale hyperparameter for each type of parameter (weights and biases) in each layer - a total of 8 hyperparameters. Results are shown in Figure 5.\nInterestingly, the initialization scale chosen for the first layer weights matches a heuristic which says to choose an initialization scale of 1/ \u221a N , where N is the number of weights in the layer."

Indeed, Snoek et al.

We can think of these architectures as hard constraints that force particular weights to be zero and tie particular pairs of weights together. By softening these hard architectural constraints we can form continuous (but very high-dimensional) parameterizations of architecture. Having access to hypergradients makes learning these softened architectures feasible.\nWe illustrate this \u201carchitecture learning\u201d with a multitask learning problem, the Omniglot data set (Lake, 2014). This data set consists of 28x28 pixel greyscale images of characters from 50 alphabets with up to 55 characters in each alphabet but only 15 examples of each character. Rather than learning a separate neural net for each alphabet, a multitask approach would be for all the neural nets to share a single first layer, pooling statistical strength to learn generic Gabor-like filters, while maintaining separate higher layers specific to each alphabet.\nWe can parameterize any architecture based on weight tying or weight absence with a pairwise quadratic penalty on the weights, wTAw, where A is a number-of-weights by number-of-weights matrix. Learning this enormous matrix is clearly infeasible but we can implicitly build such a matrix from lower dimensional structures of manageable size.\nFor the Omniglot problem, we learn a penalty for each alphabet pair, separately for each neural net layer. Thus, for ten three-layer neural networks, the penalty matrix A is fully described by three ten-by-ten matrices. An architecture with fully independent nets for each alphabet corresponds to three diagonal matrices while an architecture with a mutual lower layer corresponds to two diagonal ma-\ntrices for the upper layers and a matrix of all ones for the lowest layer (Figure 9).\nWe use five alphabets from the Omniglot set. To see whether our multitask learning system is able to learn high level similarities as well as low-level similarities, we repeat these five alphabets with the images rotated by 90 degrees (Figure 8) to make ten alphabets total.\nFigure 9 shows the learned penalties (normalized by row and column to have ones on the diagonal, akin to a correlation matrix). We see that the lowest layer has been partially shared, across all alphabets equally, with the upper layers much less shared. Interestingly, the top layer penalty learns to share weights between the rotated alphabets.\nInput Middle Output Train Test weights weights weights error error"

Likewise, the use of hypergradients also has several apparent difficulties that need to be addressed before it becomes practical. This section explores several issues with this technique that became apparent in our experiments.\nWhen are gradients meaningful? Bengio et al. (1994) noted that \u201clearning long-term dependencies with gradient descent is difficult.\u201d Our situation is even worse: We are using gradients to optimize functions which depend on their hyperparameters through hundreds of iterations of SGD. To make things worse, each elementary iteration\u2019s gradient itself depends on forward- and then back-propagation through a neural network. Thus the same issues that sometimes make elementary learning difficult are compounded.\nFor example, Pearlmutter (1996, Chapter 4) showed that large learning rates induce chaotic behavior in the learning dynamics, making the gradient uninformative about the medium-term shape of the training objective. This phenomenon is related to the exploding-gradient problem (Pascanu et al., 2012).\nFigure 10 illustrates this phenomenon when training a neural network having 2 hidden layers for 50 elementary iterations. We partially addressed this problem in our experiments by initializing learning rates to be relatively small, and stopping meta-optimization when the magnitude of the meta-gradient began to grow.\nOverfitting How many hyperparameters can we fruitfully optimize? One limitation is overfitting the validation objective, in the same way that optimizing too many parameters can overfit the training objective. However, the same rules of thumb still apply \u2013 the size of the validation set, assuming examples are i.i.d., gives a rough guide to\nhow many hyperparameters can be optimized.\nDiscrete parameters Of course, gradients are not necessarily useful for optimizing discrete hyperparameters such as the number of layers, or hyperparameters that affect discrete changes such as dropout regularization parameters. Some of these difficulties could be addressed by parameterizing apparently discrete choices in a continuous manner. For instance, the per-hidden-unit regularization of section 3.2 is an example of a continuous way to choose the number of hidden units."

(2002) introduced a differentiable bound on the SVM loss in order to be able to compute derivatives with respect to hundreds of hyperparameters, including weighting parameters for each input dimension in the kernel. However, this bound was not tight, since optimizing the SVM objective requires a discrete selection of training points.\nBayesian methods For Bayesian models with a closedform marginal likelihood, gradients with respect to all continuous hyperparameters are usually available. For example, this ability has been used to construct complex kernels for Gaussian process models (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006, Chapter 5). Variational inference also allows gradient-based tuning of hyperparameters in Bayesian neural-network models such as deep Gaussian processes (Hensman & Lawrence, 2014). However, it does not provide gradients with respect to training parameters.\nGradients with respect to Markov chain parameters Salimans et al. (2014) tune the step-size and mass-matrix parameters of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo by chaining gradients from a lower bound on the marginal likelihood through several iterations of leapfrog dynamics. Because they used only a small number of steps, all intermediate values could be stored na\u0131\u0308vely. Our reversible-dynamics memory-tape approach could be used to dramatically extend the number of HMC iterations used in this approach."

For example, Gaussian-process-based optimization methods could incorporate gradient information (Solak et al., 2003). Such methods could make use of parallel evaluations of hypergradients, which might be too slow to evaluate in a sequential manner.\nReversible elementary computation Recurrent neural network models can require so much memory to differentiate that checkpointing is required simply to compute their elementary gradients (Martens & Sutskever, 2012). Reversible computation might offer memory savings for some architectures. For example, evaluations of Long ShortTerm Memory (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) or a Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014) rely on long chains of mostly-small updates of parameters. Exactly reversing these dynamics might allow more memory-efficient elementary gradient evaluations of their outputs on very long input sequences.\nExactly reversing other learning methods The memory saving trick from Section 2.3 could presumably be applied\nto other momentum-based variants of SGD such as RMSprop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) or Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014)."

We showed how the approximate reversibility of learning dynamics can be used to drastically reduce the memory requirement for exactly backpropagating gradients through hundreds of training iterations.\nWe showed how these gradients allow the optimization of validation loss with respect to thousands of hyperparameters, something which was previously infeasible. This new ability allows the automatic tuning of most details of training neural networks. We demonstrated the tuning of detailed training schedules, regularization schedules, and neural network architectures."
