A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a singleunk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT\u201914 English to French translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. With 37.5 BLEU points, our NMT system is the first to surpass the best result achieved on a WMT\u201914 contest task.",

An NMT system is a conceptually simple large neural\n\u2217Work done while the authors were in Google.\u2020 indicates equal contribution.\nnetwork that reads the entire source sentence and produces an output translation one word at a time. NMT systems are appealing because they use minimal domain knowledge which makes them well-suited to any problem that can be formulated as mapping an input sequence to an output sequence (Sutskever et al., 2014). In addition, the natural ability of neural networks to generalize implies that NMT systems will also generalize to novel word phrases and sentences that do not occur in the training set. In addition, NMT systems potentially remove the need to store explicit phrase tables and language models which are used in conventional systems. Finally, the decoder of an NMT system is easy to implement, unlike the highly intricate decoders used by phrase-based systems (Koehn et al., 2003).\nDespite these advantages, conventional NMT systems are incapable of translating rare words because they have a fixed modest-sized vocabulary1 which forces them to use theunk symbol to represent the large number of out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words, as illustrated in Figure 1. Unsurprisingly, both Sutskever et al. (2014) and Bahdanau et al. (2015) have observed that sentences with many rare words tend to be translated much more poorly than sentences containing mainly frequent words. Standard phrasebased systems (Koehn et al., 2007; Chiang, 2007; Cer et al., 2010; Dyer et al., 2010), on the other hand, do not suffer from the rare word problem to the same extent because they can support a much larger vocabulary, and because their use of explicit alignments and phrase tables allows them to memorize the translations of even extremely rare\n1 Due to the computationally intensive nature of the softmax, NMT systems often limit their vocabularies to be the top 30K-80K most frequent words in each language. However, Jean et al. (2015) has very recently proposed an efficient approximation to the softmax that allows for training NTMs with very large vocabularies. As discussed in Section 2, this technique is complementary to ours.\nen: Theecotaxportico inPont-de-Buis, . . .

Motivated by the strengths of standard phrasebased system, we propose and implement a novel approach to address the rare word problem of NMTs. Our approach annotates the training corpus with explicit alignment information that enables the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word, a \u201cpointer\u201d to its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates the OOV words using a dictionary or with the identity translation, if no translation is found.\nOur experiments confirm that this approach is effective. On the English to French WMT\u201914 translation task, this approach provides an improvement of up to 2.8 (if the vocabulary is relatively small) BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. Moreover, our system is the first NMT that outperforms the winner of a WMT\u201914 task."

More concretely, an NMT system uses a neural network to parameterize the conditional distributions\np(tj |t<j, s\u2264n) (1)\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. By doing so, it becomes possible to compute and therefore maximize the log probability of the target sentence given the source sentence\nlog p(t|s) = m\u2211\nj=1\nlog p (tj|t<j, s\u2264n) (2)\nThere are many ways to parameterize these conditional distributions. For example, Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) used a combination of a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network, Sutskever et al. (2014) used a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, Cho et al. (2014) used an architecture similar to the LSTM, and Bahdanau et al. (2015) used a more elaborate neural network architecture that uses an attentional mechanism over the input sequence, similar to Graves (2013) and Graves et al. (2014).\nIn this work, we use the model of Sutskever et al. (2014), which uses a deep LSTM to encode the input sequence and a separate deep LSTM to output the translation. The encoder reads the source sentence, one word at a time, and produces a large vector that represents the entire source sentence. The decoder is initialized with this vector and generates a translation, one word at a time, until it emits the end-of-sentence symbol<eos>.\nNone the early work in neural machine translation systems has addressed the rare word problem, but the recent work of Jean et al. (2015) has tackled it with an efficient approximation to the softmax to accommodate for a very large vocabulary (500K words). However, even with a large vocabulary, the problem with rare words, e.g., names, numbers, etc., still persists, and Jean et al. (2015) found that using techniques similar to ours are beneficial and complementary to their approach."

(2015)\u2019s work mentioned earlier.\nWe propose to address the rare word problem by training the NMT system to track the origins of the unknown words in the target sentences. If we knew the source word responsible for each unknown target word, we could introduce a postprocessing step that would replace eachunk in the system\u2019s output with a translation of its source word, using either a dictionary or the identity translation. For example, in Figure 1, if the model knows that the second unknown token in the NMT (linenn) originates from the source word ecotax , it can perform a word dictionary lookup to replace that unknown token bye\u0301cotaxe . Similarly, an identity translation of the source word Pont-de-Buis can be applied to the third unknown token.\nWe present three annotation strategies that can easily be applied to any NMT system (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014). We treat the NMT system as a black box and train it on a corpus annotated by one of the models below. First, the alignments are produced with an unsupervised aligner. Next, we use the alignment links to construct a word dictionary that will be used for the word translations in the post-processing step.2 If a word does not appear in our dictionary, then we apply the identity translation.\nThe first few words of the sentence pair in Figure 1 (linesenandfr) illustrate our models."

The former word is known on the source sentence; whereas latter is not, so it is labelled withunk\u2205. This happens often since the source vocabularies of our models tend to be much larger than the target vocabulary since a large source vocabulary is cheap. This limitation motivated us to develop an annotation model that includes the complete alignments between the source and the target sentences, which is straightforward to obtain since the complete alignments are available at training time.\nSpecifically, we return to using only a single universal unk token. However, on the target side, we insert a positional tokenpd after every word. Here,d indicates a relative position (d = \u22127, . . . ,\u22121, 0, 1, . . . , 7) to denote that a target word at positionj is aligned to a source word at positioni = j \u2212 d.

This motivates ourpositional unknownmodel which usesunkposd tokens (ford in \u22127, . . . , 7 or \u2205) to simultaneously denote (a) the fact that a word is unknown and (b) its relative positiond with respect to its aligned source word. Like the PosAll model, we use the symbol unkpos\u2205 for unknown target words that do not have an alignment. We use the universalunk for all unknown tokens in the source language. See Figure 4 for an annotated example.\nIt is possible that despite its slower speed, the PosAll model will learn better alignments because it is trained on many more examples of words and their alignments.

In more details, we train multi-layer deep LSTMs, each of which has 1000 cells, with 1000 dimensional embeddings. Like Sutskever et al. (2014), we reverse the words in the source sentences which has been shown to improve LSTM memory utilization and results in better translations of long sentences. Our hyperparameters can be summarized as follows: (a) the parameters are initialized uniformly in [-0.08, 0.08] for 4-layer models and [-0.06, 0.06] for 6- layer models, (b) SGD has a fixed learning rate of 0.7, (c) we train for 8 epochs (after 5 epochs, we begin to halve the learning rate every 0.5 epoch), (d) the size of the mini-batch is 128, and (e) we rescale the normalized gradient to ensure that its norm does not exceed 5 (Pascanu et al., 2012).\nWe also follow the GPU parallelization scheme proposed in (Sutskever et al., 2014), allowing us to reach a training speed of 5.4K words per second to train a depth-6 model with 200K source and 80K target vocabularies ; whereas Sutskever et al. (2014) achieved 6.3K words per second for a depth-4 models with 80K source and target vocabularies. Training takes about 10-14 days on an 8-GPU machine."

As such, we include a baseline model with no alignment knowledge (NoAlign) in which we simply assume that theith unknown word on the target sentence is aligned to theith unknown word in the source sentence.\nFrom the results in Figure 6, a simple monotone alignment assumption for theNoAlignmodel yields a modest gain of 0.8 BLEU points. If we train the model to predict the alignment, then the Copyablemodel offers a slightly better gain of 1.0 BLEU. Note, however, that English and French have similar word order structure, so it would be interesting to experiment with other language pairs, such as English and Chinese, in which the word order is not as monotonic. These harder language pairs potentially imply a smaller gain for the NoAlign model and a larger gain for the Copyable model. We leave it for future work.\nThe positional models (PosAllandPosUnk) improve translation performance by more than 2 BLEU points. This proves that the limitation of the copyable model, which forces it to align each unknown output word with an unknown input word, is considerable. In contrast, the positional mod-\nparameters: we initialize the parameters uniformly in [-0.1, 0.1], the learning rate is 1, the maximal gradient norm is 1, with a source vocabulary of 90k words, and a target vocabulary of 40k (see Section 4.2 for more details).
