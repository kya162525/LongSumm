    "abstractText": "Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012\u2014achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/ \u0303rbg/rcnn.",

            "text": "Features matter. The last decade of progress on various visual recognition tasks has been based considerably on the use of SIFT [29] and HOG [7]. But if we look at performance on the canonical visual recognition task, PASCAL VOC object detection [15], it is generally acknowledged that progress has been slow during 2010-2012, with small gains obtained by building ensemble systems and employing minor variants of successful methods.\nSIFT and HOG are blockwise orientation histograms, a representation we could associate roughly with complex cells in V1, the first cortical area in the primate visual pathway. But we also know that recognition occurs several stages downstream, which suggests that there might be hier-\narchical, multi-stage processes for computing features that are even more informative for visual recognition.\nFukushima\u2019s \u201cneocognitron\u201d [19], a biologicallyinspired hierarchical and shift-invariant model for pattern recognition, was an early attempt at just such a process. The neocognitron, however, lacked a supervised training algorithm. Building on Rumelhart et al. [33], LeCun et al. [26] showed that stochastic gradient descent via backpropagation was effective for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a class of models that extend the neocognitron.\nCNNs saw heavy use in the 1990s (e.g., [27]), but then fell out of fashion with the rise of support vector machines. In 2012, Krizhevsky et al. [25] rekindled interest in CNNs by showing substantially higher image classification accuracy on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) [9, 10]. Their success resulted from training a large CNN on 1.2 million labeled images, together with a few twists on LeCun\u2019s CNN (e.g., max(x, 0) rectifying non-linearities and \u201cdropout\u201d regularization).\nThe significance of the ImageNet result was vigorously\nar X\niv :1\n31 1.\n25 24\nv5 [\ncs .C\nV ]\n2 2\nO ct\n2 01\ndebated during the ILSVRC 2012 workshop. The central issue can be distilled to the following: To what extent do the CNN classification results on ImageNet generalize to object detection results on the PASCAL VOC Challenge?\nWe answer this question by bridging the gap between image classification and object detection. This paper is the first to show that a CNN can lead to dramatically higher object detection performance on PASCAL VOC as compared to systems based on simpler HOG-like features. To achieve this result, we focused on two problems: localizing objects with a deep network and training a high-capacity model with only a small quantity of annotated detection data.\nUnlike image classification, detection requires localizing (likely many) objects within an image. One approach frames localization as a regression problem. However, work from Szegedy et al. [38], concurrent with our own, indicates that this strategy may not fare well in practice (they report a mAP of 30.5% on VOC 2007 compared to the 58.5% achieved by our method). An alternative is to build a sliding-window detector. CNNs have been used in this way for at least two decades, typically on constrained object categories, such as faces [32, 40] and pedestrians [35]. In order to maintain high spatial resolution, these CNNs typically only have two convolutional and pooling layers. We also considered adopting a sliding-window approach. However, units high up in our network, which has five convolutional layers, have very large receptive fields (195 \u00d7 195 pixels) and strides (32\u00d732 pixels) in the input image, which makes precise localization within the sliding-window paradigm an open technical challenge.\nInstead, we solve the CNN localization problem by operating within the \u201crecognition using regions\u201d paradigm [21], which has been successful for both object detection [39] and semantic segmentation [5]. At test time, our method generates around 2000 category-independent region proposals for the input image, extracts a fixed-length feature vector from each proposal using a CNN, and then classifies each region with category-specific linear SVMs. We use a simple technique (affine image warping) to compute a fixed-size CNN input from each region proposal, regardless of the region\u2019s shape. Figure 1 presents an overview of our method and highlights some of our results. Since our system combines region proposals with CNNs, we dub the method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features.\nIn this updated version of this paper, we provide a headto-head comparison of R-CNN and the recently proposed OverFeat [34] detection system by running R-CNN on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. OverFeat uses a sliding-window CNN for detection and until now was the best performing method on ILSVRC2013 detection. We show that R-CNN significantly outperforms OverFeat, with a mAP of 31.4% versus 24.3%.\nA second challenge faced in detection is that labeled data\nis scarce and the amount currently available is insufficient for training a large CNN. The conventional solution to this problem is to use unsupervised pre-training, followed by supervised fine-tuning (e.g., [35]). The second principle contribution of this paper is to show that supervised pre-training on a large auxiliary dataset (ILSVRC), followed by domainspecific fine-tuning on a small dataset (PASCAL), is an effective paradigm for learning high-capacity CNNs when data is scarce. In our experiments, fine-tuning for detection improves mAP performance by 8 percentage points. After fine-tuning, our system achieves a mAP of 54% on VOC 2010 compared to 33% for the highly-tuned, HOG-based deformable part model (DPM) [17, 20]. We also point readers to contemporaneous work by Donahue et al. [12], who show that Krizhevsky\u2019s CNN can be used (without finetuning) as a blackbox feature extractor, yielding excellent performance on several recognition tasks including scene classification, fine-grained sub-categorization, and domain adaptation.\nOur system is also quite efficient. The only class-specific computations are a reasonably small matrix-vector product and greedy non-maximum suppression. This computational property follows from features that are shared across all categories and that are also two orders of magnitude lowerdimensional than previously used region features (cf. [39]).\nUnderstanding the failure modes of our approach is also critical for improving it, and so we report results from the detection analysis tool of Hoiem et al. [23]. As an immediate consequence of this analysis, we demonstrate that a simple bounding-box regression method significantly reduces mislocalizations, which are the dominant error mode.\nBefore developing technical details, we note that because R-CNN operates on regions it is natural to extend it to the task of semantic segmentation. With minor modifications, we also achieve competitive results on the PASCAL VOC segmentation task, with an average segmentation accuracy of 47.9% on the VOC 2011 test set."

A variety of recent papers offer methods for generating category-independent region proposals.\nExamples include: objectness [1], selective search [39], category-independent object proposals [14], constrained parametric min-cuts (CPMC) [5], multi-scale combinatorial grouping [3], and Cires\u0327an et al. [6], who detect mitotic cells by applying a CNN to regularly-spaced square crops, which are a special case of region proposals. While R-CNN is agnostic to the particular region proposal method, we use selective search to enable a controlled comparison with prior detection work (e.g., [39, 41]).\nFeature extraction. We extract a 4096-dimensional feature vector from each region proposal using the Caffe [24] implementation of the CNN described by Krizhevsky et al. [25]. Features are computed by forward propagating a mean-subtracted 227\u00d7 227 RGB image through five convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. We refer readers to [24, 25] for more network architecture details.\nIn order to compute features for a region proposal, we must first convert the image data in that region into a form that is compatible with the CNN (its architecture requires inputs of a fixed 227 \u00d7 227 pixel size). Of the many possible transformations of our arbitrary-shaped regions, we opt for the simplest. Regardless of the size or aspect ratio of the candidate region, we warp all pixels in a tight bounding box around it to the required size. Prior to warping, we dilate the tight bounding box so that at the warped size there are exactly p pixels of warped image context around the original box (we use p = 16). Figure 2 shows a random sampling of warped training regions. Alternatives to warping are discussed in Appendix A."

We warp each proposal and forward propagate it through the CNN in order to compute features. Then, for each class, we score each extracted feature vector using the SVM trained for that class. Given all scored regions in an image, we apply a greedy non-maximum suppression (for each class independently) that rejects a region if it has an intersection-overunion (IoU) overlap with a higher scoring selected region larger than a learned threshold.\nRun-time analysis. Two properties make detection efficient. First, all CNN parameters are shared across all categories. Second, the feature vectors computed by the CNN\nare low-dimensional when compared to other common approaches, such as spatial pyramids with bag-of-visual-word encodings. The features used in the UVA detection system [39], for example, are two orders of magnitude larger than ours (360k vs. 4k-dimensional).\nThe result of such sharing is that the time spent computing region proposals and features (13s/image on a GPU or 53s/image on a CPU) is amortized over all classes. The only class-specific computations are dot products between features and SVM weights and non-maximum suppression. In practice, all dot products for an image are batched into a single matrix-matrix product. The feature matrix is typically 2000\u00d74096 and the SVM weight matrix is 4096\u00d7N , where N is the number of classes.\nThis analysis shows that R-CNN can scale to thousands of object classes without resorting to approximate techniques, such as hashing. Even if there were 100k classes, the resulting matrix multiplication takes only 10 seconds on a modern multi-core CPU. This efficiency is not merely the result of using region proposals and shared features. The UVA system, due to its high-dimensional features, would be two orders of magnitude slower while requiring 134GB of memory just to store 100k linear predictors, compared to just 1.5GB for our lower-dimensional features.\nIt is also interesting to contrast R-CNN with the recent work from Dean et al. on scalable detection using DPMs and hashing [8]. They report a mAP of around 16% on VOC 2007 at a run-time of 5 minutes per image when introducing 10k distractor classes. With our approach, 10k detectors can run in about a minute on a CPU, and because no approximations are made mAP would remain at 59% (Section 3.2)."

            "text": "Supervised pre-training. We discriminatively pre-trained the CNN on a large auxiliary dataset (ILSVRC2012 classification) using image-level annotations only (boundingbox labels are not available for this data). Pre-training was performed using the open source Caffe CNN library [24]. In brief, our CNN nearly matches the performance of Krizhevsky et al. [25], obtaining a top-1 error rate 2.2 percentage points higher on the ILSVRC2012 classification validation set. This discrepancy is due to simplifications in the training process.\nDomain-specific fine-tuning. To adapt our CNN to the new task (detection) and the new domain (warped proposal windows), we continue stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training of the CNN parameters using only warped region proposals. Aside from replacing the CNN\u2019s ImageNetspecific 1000-way classification layer with a randomly initialized (N + 1)-way classification layer (where N is the number of object classes, plus 1 for background), the CNN architecture is unchanged. For VOC, N = 20 and for ILSVRC2013, N = 200. We treat all region proposals with\n\u2265 0.5 IoU overlap with a ground-truth box as positives for that box\u2019s class and the rest as negatives. We start SGD at a learning rate of 0.001 (1/10th of the initial pre-training rate), which allows fine-tuning to make progress while not clobbering the initialization. In each SGD iteration, we uniformly sample 32 positive windows (over all classes) and 96 background windows to construct a mini-batch of size 128. We bias the sampling towards positive windows because they are extremely rare compared to background.\nObject category classifiers. Consider training a binary classifier to detect cars. It\u2019s clear that an image region tightly enclosing a car should be a positive example. Similarly, it\u2019s clear that a background region, which has nothing to do with cars, should be a negative example. Less clear is how to label a region that partially overlaps a car. We resolve this issue with an IoU overlap threshold, below which regions are defined as negatives. The overlap threshold, 0.3, was selected by a grid search over {0, 0.1, . . . , 0.5} on a validation set. We found that selecting this threshold carefully is important. Setting it to 0.5, as in [39], decreased mAP by 5 points. Similarly, setting it to 0 decreased mAP by 4 points. Positive examples are defined simply to be the ground-truth bounding boxes for each class.\nOnce features are extracted and training labels are applied, we optimize one linear SVM per class. Since the training data is too large to fit in memory, we adopt the standard hard negative mining method [17, 37]. Hard negative mining converges quickly and in practice mAP stops increasing after only a single pass over all images.\nIn Appendix B we discuss why the positive and negative examples are defined differently in fine-tuning versus SVM training. We also discuss the trade-offs involved in training detection SVMs rather than simply using the outputs from the final softmax layer of the fine-tuned CNN."

We compare our method against four strong baselines, including SegDPM [18], which combines DPM detectors with the output of a semantic segmentation system [4] and uses additional inter-detector context and image-classifier rescoring. The most germane comparison is to the UVA system from Uijlings et al. [39], since our systems use the same region proposal algorithm. To classify regions, their method builds a four-level spatial pyramid and populates it with\ndensely sampled SIFT, Extended OpponentSIFT, and RGBSIFT descriptors, each vector quantized with 4000-word codebooks. Classification is performed with a histogram intersection kernel SVM. Compared to their multi-feature, non-linear kernel SVM approach, we achieve a large improvement in mAP, from 35.1% to 53.7% mAP, while also being much faster (Section 2.2).

Understanding the subsequent layers is more challenging. Zeiler and Fergus present a visually attractive deconvolutional approach in [42]. We propose a simple (and complementary) non-parametric method that directly shows what the network learned.\nThe idea is to single out a particular unit (feature) in the network and use it as if it were an object detector in its own right. That is, we compute the unit\u2019s activations on a large set of held-out region proposals (about 10 million), sort the proposals from highest to lowest activation, perform nonmaximum suppression, and then display the top-scoring regions. Our method lets the selected unit \u201cspeak for itself\u201d by showing exactly which inputs it fires on. We avoid averaging in order to see different visual modes and gain insight into the invariances computed by the unit.\nWe visualize units from layer pool5, which is the maxpooled output of the network\u2019s fifth and final convolutional layer. The pool5 feature map is 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 256 = 9216- dimensional. Ignoring boundary effects, each pool5 unit has a receptive field of 195\u00d7195 pixels in the original 227\u00d7227 pixel input. A central pool5 unit has a nearly global view, while one near the edge has a smaller, clipped support.\nEach row in Figure 4 displays the top 16 activations for a pool5 unit from a CNN that we fine-tuned on VOC 2007 trainval. Six of the 256 functionally unique units are visualized (Appendix D includes more). These units were selected to show a representative sample of what the network learns. In the second row, we see a unit that fires on dog faces and dot arrays. The unit corresponding to the third row is a red blob detector. There are also detectors for human faces and more abstract patterns such as text and triangular structures with windows. The network appears to learn a representation that combines a small number of class-tuned features together with a distributed representation of shape, texture, color, and material properties.

To understand which layers are critical for detection performance, we analyzed results on the VOC 2007 dataset for each of the CNN\u2019s last three layers. Layer pool5 was briefly described in Section 3.1. The final two layers are summarized below.\nLayer fc6 is fully connected to pool5. To compute features, it multiplies a 4096\u00d79216 weight matrix by the pool5 feature map (reshaped as a 9216-dimensional vector) and then adds a vector of biases. This intermediate vector is component-wise half-wave rectified (x\u2190 max(0, x)).\nLayer fc7 is the final layer of the network. It is implemented by multiplying the features computed by fc6 by a 4096 \u00d7 4096 weight matrix, and similarly adding a vector of biases and applying half-wave rectification.\nWe start by looking at results from the CNN without fine-tuning on PASCAL, i.e. all CNN parameters were pre-trained on ILSVRC 2012 only. Analyzing performance layer-by-layer (Table 2 rows 1-3) reveals that features from fc7 generalize worse than features from fc6. This means that 29%, or about 16.8 million, of the CNN\u2019s parameters can be removed without degrading mAP. More surprising is that removing both fc7 and fc6 produces quite good results even though pool5 features are computed using only 6% of the CNN\u2019s parameters. Much of the CNN\u2019s representational power comes from its convolutional layers, rather than from the much larger densely connected layers. This finding suggests potential utility in computing a dense feature map, in the sense of HOG, of an arbitrary-sized image by using only the convolutional layers of the CNN. This representation would enable experimentation with sliding-window detectors, including DPM, on top of pool5 features.\nPerformance layer-by-layer, with fine-tuning. We now look at results from our CNN after having fine-tuned its pa-\nrameters on VOC 2007 trainval. The improvement is striking (Table 2 rows 4-6): fine-tuning increases mAP by 8.0 percentage points to 54.2%. The boost from fine-tuning is much larger for fc6 and fc7 than for pool5, which suggests that the pool5 features learned from ImageNet are general and that most of the improvement is gained from learning domain-specific non-linear classifiers on top of them.\nComparison to recent feature learning methods. Relatively few feature learning methods have been tried on PASCAL VOC detection. We look at two recent approaches that build on deformable part models. For reference, we also include results for the standard HOG-based DPM [20].\nThe first DPM feature learning method, DPM ST [28], augments HOG features with histograms of \u201csketch token\u201d probabilities. Intuitively, a sketch token is a tight distribution of contours passing through the center of an image patch. Sketch token probabilities are computed at each pixel by a random forest that was trained to classify 35\u00d735 pixel patches into one of 150 sketch tokens or background.\nThe second method, DPM HSC [31], replaces HOG with histograms of sparse codes (HSC). To compute an HSC, sparse code activations are solved for at each pixel using a learned dictionary of 100 7 \u00d7 7 pixel (grayscale) atoms. The resulting activations are rectified in three ways (full and both half-waves), spatially pooled, unit `2 normalized, and then power transformed (x\u2190 sign(x)|x|\u03b1).\nAll R-CNN variants strongly outperform the three DPM baselines (Table 2 rows 8-10), including the two that use feature learning. Compared to the latest version of DPM, which uses only HOG features, our mAP is more than 20 percentage points higher: 54.2% vs. 33.7%\u2014a 61% relative improvement. The combination of HOG and sketch tokens yields 2.5 mAP points over HOG alone, while HSC improves over HOG by 4 mAP points (when compared internally to their private DPM baselines\u2014both use nonpublic implementations of DPM that underperform the open source version [20]). These methods achieve mAPs of 29.1% and 34.3%, respectively."

Each plot shows the mean (over classes) normalized AP (see [23]) for the highest and lowest performing subsets within six different object characteristics (occlusion, truncation, bounding-box area, aspect ratio, viewpoint, part visibility). We show plots for our method (R-CNN) with and without fine-tuning (FT) and bounding-box regression (BB) as well as for DPM voc-release5. Overall, fine-tuning does not reduce sensitivity (the difference between max and min), but does substantially improve both the highest and lowest performing subsets for nearly all characteristics. This indicates that fine-tuning does more than simply improve the lowest performing subsets for aspect ratio and bounding-box area, as one might conjecture based on how we warp network inputs. Instead, fine-tuning improves robustness for all characteristics including occlusion, truncation, viewpoint, and part visibility.\nEach plot shows the evolving distribution of FP types as more FPs are considered in order of decreasing score. Each FP is categorized into 1 of 4 types: Loc\u2014poor localization (a detection with an IoU overlap with the correct class between 0.1 and 0.5, or a duplicate); Sim\u2014confusion with a similar category; Oth\u2014confusion with a dissimilar object category; BG\u2014a FP that fired on background. Compared with DPM (see [23]), significantly more of our errors result from poor localization, rather than confusion with background or other object classes, indicating that the CNN features are much more discriminative than HOG. Loose localization likely results from our use of bottom-up region proposals and the positional invariance learned from pre-training the CNN for whole-image classification.

The\nval and test splits are drawn from the same image distribution. These images are scene-like and similar in complexity (number of objects, amount of clutter, pose variability, etc.) to PASCAL VOC images. The val and test splits are exhaustively annotated, meaning that in each image all instances from all 200 classes are labeled with bounding boxes. The train set, in contrast, is drawn from the ILSVRC2013 classification image distribution. These images have more variable complexity with a skew towards images of a single centered object. Unlike val and test, the train images (due to their large number) are not exhaustively annotated. In any given train image, instances from the 200 classes may or may not be labeled. In addition to these image sets, each class has an extra set of negative images. Negative images are manually checked to validate that they do not contain any instances of their associated class. The negative image sets were not used in this work. More information on how ILSVRC was collected and annotated can be found in [11, 36].\nThe nature of these splits presents a number of choices for training R-CNN. The train images cannot be used for hard negative mining, because annotations are not exhaustive. Where should negative examples come from? Also, the train images have different statistics than val and test. Should the train images be used at all, and if so, to what extent? While we have not thoroughly evaluated a large number of choices, we present what seemed like the most obvious path based on previous experience.\nOur general strategy is to rely heavily on the val set and use some of the train images as an auxiliary source of positive examples. To use val for both training and validation, we split it into roughly equally sized \u201cval1\u201d and \u201cval2\u201d sets. Since some classes have very few examples in val (the smallest has only 31 and half have fewer than 110), it is important to produce an approximately class-balanced partition. To do this, a large number of candidate splits were generated and the one with the smallest maximum relative\nclass imbalance was selected.2 Each candidate split was generated by clustering val images using their class counts as features, followed by a randomized local search that may improve the split balance. The particular split used here has a maximum relative imbalance of about 11% and a median relative imbalance of 4%. The val1/val2 split and code used to produce them will be publicly available to allow other researchers to compare their methods on the val splits used in this report."

ILSVRC image sizes range from very small to a few that are several mega-pixels, and so we resized each image to a fixed width (500 pixels) before running selective search. On val, selective search resulted in an average of 2403 region proposals per image with a 91.6% recall of all ground-truth bounding boxes (at 0.5 IoU threshold).

The first result, 20.9%, is what R-CNN achieves using a CNN pre-trained on the ILSVRC2012 classification dataset (no fine-tuning) and given access to the small amount of training data in val1 (recall that half of the classes in val1 have between 15 and 55 examples). Expanding the training set to val1+trainN improves performance to 24.1%, with essentially no difference between N = 500 and N = 1000. Fine-tuning the CNN using examples from just val1 gives a modest improvement to 26.5%, however there is likely significant overfitting due to the small number of positive training examples.

It is worth noting that OverFeat has a significant speed advantage over R-CNN: it is about 9x faster, based on a figure of 2 seconds per image quoted from [34]. This speed comes from the fact that OverFeat\u2019s sliding windows (i.e., region proposals) are not warped at the image level and therefore computation can be easily shared between overlapping windows. Sharing is implemented by running the entire network in a convolutional fashion over arbitrary-sized inputs. Speeding up R-CNN should be possible in a variety of ways and remains as future work."

To facilitate a direct comparison with the current leading semantic segmentation system (called O2P for \u201csecond-order pooling\u201d) [4], we work within their open source framework. O2P uses CPMC to generate 150 region proposals per image and then predicts the quality of each region, for each class, using support vector regression (SVR). The high performance of their approach is due to the quality of the CPMC regions and the powerful second-order pooling of multiple feature types (enriched variants of SIFT and LBP). We also note that Farabet et al. [16] recently demonstrated good results on several dense scene labeling datasets (not including PASCAL) using a CNN as a multi-scale per-pixel classifier.\nWe follow [2, 4] and extend the PASCAL segmentation training set to include the extra annotations made available by Hariharan et al. [22]. Design decisions and hyperparameters were cross-validated on the VOC 2011 validation set. Final test results were evaluated only once.\nCNN features for segmentation. We evaluate three strategies for computing features on CPMC regions, all of which begin by warping the rectangular window around the region to 227 \u00d7 227. The first strategy (full) ignores the re-\ngion\u2019s shape and computes CNN features directly on the warped window, exactly as we did for detection. However, these features ignore the non-rectangular shape of the region. Two regions might have very similar bounding boxes while having very little overlap. Therefore, the second strategy (fg) computes CNN features only on a region\u2019s foreground mask. We replace the background with the mean input so that background regions are zero after mean subtraction. The third strategy (full+fg) simply concatenates the full and fg features; our experiments validate their complementarity.\nResults on VOC 2011. Table 5 shows a summary of our results on the VOC 2011 validation set compared with O2P. (See Appendix E for complete per-category results.) Within each feature computation strategy, layer fc6 always outperforms fc7 and the following discussion refers to the fc6 features. The fg strategy slightly outperforms full, indicating that the masked region shape provides a stronger signal, matching our intuition. However, full+fg achieves an average accuracy of 47.9%, our best result by a margin of 4.2% (also modestly outperforming O2P), indicating that the context provided by the full features is highly informative even given the fg features. Notably, training the 20 SVRs on our full+fg features takes an hour on a single core, compared to 10+ hours for training on O2P features.\nIn Table 6 we present results on the VOC 2011 test set, comparing our best-performing method, fc6 (full+fg), against two strong baselines. Our method achieves the highest segmentation accuracy for 11 out of 21 categories, and the highest overall segmentation accuracy of 47.9%, averaged across categories (but likely ties with the O2P result under any reasonable margin of error). Still better performance could likely be achieved by fine-tuning."

The best performing systems were complex ensembles combining multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. This paper presents a simple and scalable object detection algorithm that gives a 30% relative improvement over the best previous results on PASCAL VOC 2012.\nWe achieved this performance through two insights. The first is to apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects. The second is a paradigm for training large CNNs when labeled training data is scarce. We show that it is highly effective to pre-train the network\u2014 with supervision\u2014for a auxiliary task with abundant data (image classification) and then to fine-tune the network for the target task where data is scarce (detection). We conjecture that the \u201csupervised pre-training/domain-specific finetuning\u201d paradigm will be highly effective for a variety of data-scarce vision problems.\nWe conclude by noting that it is significant that we achieved these results by using a combination of classical tools from computer vision and deep learning (bottomup region proposals and convolutional neural networks). Rather than opposing lines of scientific inquiry, the two are natural and inevitable partners.\nAcknowledgments.

For detection, we consider object proposals that are arbitrary image rectangles. We evaluated two approaches for transforming object proposals into valid CNN inputs.\nThe first method (\u201ctightest square with context\u201d) encloses each object proposal inside the tightest square and\nthen scales (isotropically) the image contained in that square to the CNN input size. Figure 7 column (B) shows this transformation. A variant on this method (\u201ctightest square without context\u201d) excludes the image content that surrounds the original object proposal. Figure 7 column (C) shows this transformation. The second method (\u201cwarp\u201d) anisotropically scales each object proposal to the CNN input size. Figure 7 column (D) shows the warp transformation.\nFor each of these transformations, we also consider including additional image context around the original object proposal. The amount of context padding (p) is defined as a border size around the original object proposal in the transformed input coordinate frame. Figure 7 shows p = 0 pixels in the top row of each example and p = 16 pixels in the bottom row. In all methods, if the source rectangle extends beyond the image, the missing data is replaced with the image mean (which is then subtracted before inputing the image into the CNN). A pilot set of experiments showed that warping with context padding (p = 16 pixels) outperformed the alternatives by a large margin (3-5 mAP points). Obviously more alternatives are possible, including using replication instead of mean padding. Exhaustive evaluation of these alternatives is left as future work."

            "heading": "B. Positive vs. negative examples and softmax",
            "text": "Two design choices warrant further discussion. The first is: Why are positive and negative examples defined differently for fine-tuning the CNN versus training the object detection SVMs? To review the definitions briefly, for finetuning we map each object proposal to the ground-truth instance with which it has maximum IoU overlap (if any) and label it as a positive for the matched ground-truth class if the IoU is at least 0.5. All other proposals are labeled \u201cbackground\u201d (i.e., negative examples for all classes). For training SVMs, in contrast, we take only the ground-truth boxes as positive examples for their respective classes and label proposals with less than 0.3 IoU overlap with all instances of a class as a negative for that class. Proposals that fall into the grey zone (more than 0.3 IoU overlap, but are not ground truth) are ignored.\nHistorically speaking, we arrived at these definitions because we started by training SVMs on features computed by the ImageNet pre-trained CNN, and so fine-tuning was not a consideration at that point in time. In that setup, we found that our particular label definition for training SVMs was optimal within the set of options we evaluated (which included the setting we now use for fine-tuning). When we started using fine-tuning, we initially used the same positive and negative example definition as we were using for SVM training. However, we found that results were much worse than those obtained using our current definition of positives and negatives.\nOur hypothesis is that this difference in how positives and negatives are defined is not fundamentally important and arises from the fact that fine-tuning data is limited. Our current scheme introduces many \u201cjittered\u201d examples (those proposals with overlap between 0.5 and 1, but not ground truth), which expands the number of positive examples by approximately 30x. We conjecture that this large set is needed when fine-tuning the entire network to avoid overfitting. However, we also note that using these jittered examples is likely suboptimal because the network is not being fine-tuned for precise localization.\nThis leads to the second issue: Why, after fine-tuning, train SVMs at all? It would be cleaner to simply apply the last layer of the fine-tuned network, which is a 21-way softmax regression classifier, as the object detector. We tried this and found that performance on VOC 2007 dropped from 54.2% to 50.9% mAP. This performance drop likely arises from a combination of several factors including that the definition of positive examples used in fine-tuning does not emphasize precise localization and the softmax classifier was trained on randomly sampled negative examples rather than on the subset of \u201chard negatives\u201d used for SVM training.\nThis result shows that it\u2019s possible to obtain close to the same level of performance without training SVMs af-\nter fine-tuning. We conjecture that with some additional tweaks to fine-tuning the remaining performance gap may be closed. If true, this would simplify and speed up R-CNN training with no loss in detection performance."

After scoring each selective search proposal with a class-specific detection SVM, we predict a new bounding box for the detection using a class-specific bounding-box regressor. This is similar in spirit to the bounding-box regression used in deformable part models [17]. The primary difference between the two approaches is that here we regress from features computed by the CNN, rather than from geometric features computed on the inferred DPM part locations.\nThe input to our training algorithm is a set of N training pairs {(P i, Gi)}i=1,...,N , where P i = (P ix, P iy, P iw, P ih) specifies the pixel coordinates of the center of proposal P i\u2019s bounding box together with P i\u2019s width and height in pixels. Hence forth, we drop the superscript i unless it is needed. Each ground-truth bounding box G is specified in the same way: G = (Gx, Gy, Gw, Gh). Our goal is to learn a transformation that maps a proposed box P to a ground-truth box G.\nWe parameterize the transformation in terms of four functions dx(P ), dy(P ), dw(P ), and dh(P ). The first two specify a scale-invariant translation of the center of P \u2019s bounding box, while the second two specify log-space translations of the width and height of P \u2019s bounding box. After learning these functions, we can transform an input proposal P into a predicted ground-truth box G\u0302 by applying the transformation\nG\u0302x = Pwdx(P ) + Px (1)\nG\u0302y = Phdy(P ) + Py (2)\nG\u0302w = Pw exp(dw(P )) (3)\nG\u0302h = Ph exp(dh(P )). (4)\nEach function d?(P ) (where ? is one of x, y, h, w) is modeled as a linear function of the pool5 features of proposal P , denoted by \u03c65(P ). (The dependence of \u03c65(P ) on the image data is implicitly assumed.) Thus we have d?(P ) = w T ?\u03c65(P ), where w? is a vector of learnable model parameters. We learn w? by optimizing the regularized least squares objective (ridge regression):\nw? = argmin w\u0302? N\u2211 i (ti? \u2212 w\u0302T?\u03c65(P i))2 + \u03bb \u2016w\u0302?\u2016 2 . (5)\nThe regression targets t? for the training pair (P,G) are defined as\ntx = (Gx \u2212 Px)/Pw (6) ty = (Gy \u2212 Py)/Ph (7) tw = log(Gw/Pw) (8) th = log(Gh/Ph). (9)\nAs a standard regularized least squares problem, this can be solved efficiently in closed form.\nWe found two subtle issues while implementing bounding-box regression. The first is that regularization is important: we set \u03bb = 1000 based on a validation set. The second issue is that care must be taken when selecting which training pairs (P,G) to use. Intuitively, if P is far from all ground-truth boxes, then the task of transforming P to a ground-truth box G does not make sense. Using examples like P would lead to a hopeless learning problem. Therefore, we only learn from a proposal P if it is nearby at least one ground-truth box. We implement \u201cnearness\u201d by assigning P to the ground-truth box G with which it has maximum IoU overlap (in case it overlaps more than one) if and only if the overlap is greater than a threshold (which we set to 0.6 using a validation set). All unassigned proposals are discarded. We do this once for each object class in order to learn a set of class-specific bounding-box regressors.\nAt test time, we score each proposal and predict its new detection window only once. In principle, we could iterate this procedure (i.e., re-score the newly predicted bounding box, and then predict a new bounding box from it, and so on). However, we found that iterating does not improve results."

Our findings may be useful to researchers who are interested in using ILSVRC 2012 as training data for the PASCAL image classification task.\nWe performed two checks for duplicate (and nearduplicate) images. The first test is based on exact matches of flickr image IDs, which are included in the VOC 2007 test annotations (these IDs are intentionally kept secret for subsequent PASCAL test sets). All PASCAL images, and about half of ILSVRC, were collected from flickr.com. This check turned up 31 matches out of 4952 (0.63%).\nThe second check uses GIST [30] descriptor matching, which was shown in [13] to have excellent performance at near-duplicate image detection in large (> 1 million) image collections. Following [13], we computed GIST descriptors on warped 32\u00d7 32 pixel versions of all ILSVRC 2012 trainval and PASCAL 2007 test images.\nEuclidean distance nearest-neighbor matching of GIST descriptors revealed 38 near-duplicate images (including all 31 found by flickr ID matching). The matches tend to vary slightly in JPEG compression level and resolution, and to a lesser extent cropping. These findings show that the overlap is small, less than 1%. For VOC 2012, because flickr IDs are not available, we used the GIST matching method only. Based on GIST matches, 1.5% of VOC 2012 test images are in ILSVRC 2012 trainval. The slightly higher rate for VOC 2012 is likely due to the fact that the two datasets were collected closer together in time than VOC 2007 and ILSVRC 2012 were."

To help readers understand how it has changed over time, here\u2019s a brief changelog describing the revisions.\nv1 Initial version.\nv2 CVPR 2014 camera-ready revision. Includes substantial improvements in detection performance brought about by (1) starting fine-tuning from a higher learning rate (0.001 instead of 0.0001), (2) using context padding when preparing CNN inputs, and (3) bounding-box regression to fix localization errors.\nv3 Results on the ILSVRC2013 detection dataset and comparison with OverFeat were integrated into several sections (primarily Section 2 and Section 4).\nv4 The softmax vs. SVM results in Appendix B contained an error, which has been fixed. We thank Sergio Guadarrama for helping to identify this issue.\nv5 Added results using the new 16-layer network architecture from Simonyan and Zisserman [43] to Section 3.3 and Table 3."
