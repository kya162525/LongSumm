    "abstractText": "In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder\u2013 Decoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.",

Furthermore, many recent works showed that neural networks can be successfully used in a number of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). These include, but are not limited to, language modeling (Bengio et al., 2003), paraphrase detection (Socher et al., 2011) and word embedding extraction (Mikolov et al., 2013). In the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), deep neural networks have begun to show promising results. (Schwenk, 2012) summarizes a successful usage of feedforward neural networks in the framework of phrase-based SMT system.\nAlong this line of research on using neural networks for SMT, this paper focuses on a novel neural network architecture that can be used as a part of the conventional phrase-based SMT system. The proposed neural network architecture, which we will refer to as an RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target sequence. The two networks are trained jointly to maximize the conditional probability of the target sequence given a source sequence. Additionally, we propose to use a rather sophisticated hidden unit in order to improve both the memory capacity and the ease of training.\nThe proposed RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder with a novel hidden unit is empirically evaluated on the task of translating from English to French. We train the model to learn the translation probability of an English phrase to a corresponding French phrase. The model is then used as a part of a standard phrase-based SMT system by scoring each phrase pair in the phrase table. The empirical evaluation reveals that this approach of scoring phrase pairs with an RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder improves the translation performance.\nWe qualitatively analyze the trained RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder by comparing its phrase scores with those given by the existing translation model. The qualitative analysis shows that the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder is better at capturing the linguistic regularities in the phrase table, indirectly explaining the quantitative improvements in the overall translation performance. The further analysis of the model reveals that the RNN Encoder\u2013 Decoder learns a continuous space representation of a phrase that preserves both the semantic and syntactic structure of the phrase.\nar X\niv :1\n40 6.\n10 78\nv3 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n3 S\nep 2\n01 4"

At each time step t, the hidden state h\u3008t\u3009 of the RNN is updated by\nh\u3008t\u3009 = f ( h\u3008t\u22121\u3009, xt ) , (1)\nwhere f is a non-linear activation function. f may be as simple as an elementwise logistic sigmoid function and as complex as a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).\nAn RNN can learn a probability distribution over a sequence by being trained to predict the next symbol in a sequence. In that case, the output at each timestep t is the conditional distribution p(xt | xt\u22121, . . . , x1). For example, a multinomial distribution (1-of-K coding) can be output using a softmax activation function\np(xt,j = 1 | xt\u22121, . . . , x1) = exp\n( wjh\u3008t\u3009 )\u2211K j\u2032=1 exp ( wj\u2032h\u3008t\u3009\n) , (2)\nfor all possible symbols j = 1, . . . ,K, where wj are the rows of a weight matrix W. By combining these probabilities, we can compute the probability of the sequence x using\np(x) = T\u220f t=1 p(xt | xt\u22121, . . . , x1). (3)\nFrom this learned distribution, it is straightforward to sample a new sequence by iteratively sampling a symbol at each time step."

From a probabilistic perspective, this new model is a general method to learn the conditional distribution over a variable-length sequence conditioned on yet another variable-length sequence, e.g. p(y1, . . . , yT \u2032 | x1, . . . , xT ), where one\nshould note that the input and output sequence lengths T and T \u2032 may differ.\nThe encoder is an RNN that reads each symbol of an input sequence x sequentially. As it reads each symbol, the hidden state of the RNN changes according to Eq. (1). After reading the end of the sequence (marked by an end-of-sequence symbol), the hidden state of the RNN is a summary c of the whole input sequence.\nThe decoder of the proposed model is another RNN which is trained to generate the output sequence by predicting the next symbol yt given the hidden state h\u3008t\u3009. However, unlike the RNN described in Sec. 2.1, both yt and h\u3008t\u3009 are also conditioned on yt\u22121 and on the summary c of the input sequence. Hence, the hidden state of the decoder at time t is computed by,\nh\u3008t\u3009 = f ( h\u3008t\u22121\u3009, yt\u22121, c ) ,\nand similarly, the conditional distribution of the next symbol is\nP (yt|yt\u22121, yt\u22122, . . . , y1, c) = g ( h\u3008t\u3009, yt\u22121, c ) .\nfor given activation functions f and g (the latter must produce valid probabilities, e.g. with a softmax).\nSee Fig. 1 for a graphical depiction of the proposed model architecture.\nThe two components of the proposed RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder are jointly trained to maximize the conditional log-likelihood\nmax \u03b8\n1\nN N\u2211 n=1 log p\u03b8(yn | xn), (4)\nwhere \u03b8 is the set of the model parameters and each (xn,yn) is an (input sequence, output sequence) pair from the training set. In our case, as the output of the decoder, starting from the input, is differentiable, we can use a gradient-based algorithm to estimate the model parameters.\nOnce the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder is trained, the model can be used in two ways. One way is to use the model to generate a target sequence given an input sequence. On the other hand, the model can be used to score a given pair of input and output sequences, where the score is simply a probability p\u03b8(y | x) from Eqs. (3) and (4)."

First, the reset gate rj is computed by\nrj = \u03c3 ( [Wrx]j + [ Urh\u3008t\u22121\u3009 ] j ) , (5)\nwhere \u03c3 is the logistic sigmoid function, and [.]j denotes the j-th element of a vector. x and ht\u22121 are the input and the previous hidden state, respectively. Wr and Ur are weight matrices which are learned.\nSimilarly, the update gate zj is computed by zj = \u03c3 ( [Wzx]j + [ Uzh\u3008t\u22121\u3009 ] j ) .

For details on LSTM networks, see, e.g., (Graves, 2012).\nonly. This effectively allows the hidden state to drop any information that is found to be irrelevant later in the future, thus, allowing a more compact representation.\nOn the other hand, the update gate controls how much information from the previous hidden state will carry over to the current hidden state. This acts similarly to the memory cell in the LSTM network and helps the RNN to remember longterm information. Furthermore, this may be considered an adaptive variant of a leaky-integration unit (Bengio et al., 2013).\nAs each hidden unit has separate reset and update gates, each hidden unit will learn to capture dependencies over different time scales. Those units that learn to capture short-term dependencies will tend to have reset gates that are frequently active, but those that capture longer-term dependencies will have update gates that are mostly active.\nIn our preliminary experiments, we found that it is crucial to use this new unit with gating units. We were not able to get meaningful result with an oft-used tanh unit without any gating."

In practice, however, most SMT systems model log p(f | e) as a loglinear model with additional features and corre-\nsponding weights:\nlog p(f | e) = N\u2211\nn=1\nwnfn(f , e) + logZ(e), (9)\nwhere fn and wn are the n-th feature and weight, respectively. Z(e) is a normalization constant that does not depend on the weights. The weights are often optimized to maximize the BLEU score on a development set.\nIn the phrase-based SMT framework introduced in (Koehn et al., 2003) and (Marcu and Wong, 2002), the translation model log p(e | f) is factorized into the translation probabilities of matching phrases in the source and target sentences.2 These probabilities are once again considered additional features in the log-linear model (see Eq. (9)) and are weighted accordingly to maximize the BLEU score.\nSince the neural net language model was proposed in (Bengio et al., 2003), neural networks have been used widely in SMT systems. In many cases, neural networks have been used to rescore translation hypotheses (n-best lists) (see, e.g., (Schwenk et al., 2006)). Recently, however, there has been interest in training neural networks to score the translated sentence (or phrase pairs) using a representation of the source sentence as an additional input.

(9) when tuning the SMT decoder.\nWhen we train the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder, we ignore the (normalized) frequencies of each phrase pair in the original corpora. This measure was taken in order (1) to reduce the computational expense of randomly selecting phrase pairs from a large phrase table according to the normalized frequencies and (2) to ensure that the RNN Encoder\u2013 Decoder does not simply learn to rank the phrase pairs according to their numbers of occurrences. One underlying reason for this choice was that the existing translation probability in the phrase table already reflects the frequencies of the phrase\n2 Without loss of generality, from here on, we refer to p(e | f) for each phrase pair as a translation model as well\npairs in the original corpus. With a fixed capacity of the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder, we try to ensure that most of the capacity of the model is focused toward learning linguistic regularities, i.e., distinguishing between plausible and implausible translations, or learning the \u201cmanifold\u201d (region of probability concentration) of plausible translations.\nOnce the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder is trained, we add a new score for each phrase pair to the existing phrase table. This allows the new scores to enter into the existing tuning algorithm with minimal additional overhead in computation.\nAs Schwenk pointed out in (Schwenk, 2012), it is possible to completely replace the existing phrase table with the proposed RNN Encoder\u2013 Decoder. In that case, for a given source phrase, the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder will need to generate a list of (good) target phrases. This requires, however, an expensive sampling procedure to be performed repeatedly. In this paper, thus, we only consider rescoring the phrase pairs in the phrase table."

            "text": "Before presenting the empirical results, we discuss a number of recent works that have proposed to use neural networks in the context of SMT.\nSchwenk in (Schwenk, 2012) proposed a similar approach of scoring phrase pairs. Instead of the RNN-based neural network, he used a feedforward neural network that has fixed-size inputs (7 words in his case, with zero-padding for shorter phrases) and fixed-size outputs (7 words in the target language). When it is used specifically for scoring phrases for the SMT system, the maximum phrase length is often chosen to be small. However, as the length of phrases increases or as we apply neural networks to other variable-length sequence data, it is important that the neural network can handle variable-length input and output. The proposed RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder is well-suited for these applications.\nSimilar to (Schwenk, 2012), Devlin et al. (Devlin et al., 2014) proposed to use a feedforward neural network to model a translation model, however, by predicting one word in a target phrase at a time. They reported an impressive improvement, but their approach still requires the maximum length of the input phrase (or context words) to be fixed a priori.\nAlthough it is not exactly a neural network they train, the authors of (Zou et al., 2013) proposed to learn a bilingual embedding of words/phrases. They use the learned embedding to compute the distance between a pair of phrases which is used as an additional score of the phrase pair in an SMT system.\nIn (Chandar et al., 2014), a feedforward neural network was trained to learn a mapping from a bag-of-words representation of an input phrase to an output phrase. This is closely related to both the proposed RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder and the model proposed in (Schwenk, 2012), except that their input representation of a phrase is a bag-of-words. A similar approach of using bag-of-words representations was proposed in (Gao et al., 2013) as well. Earlier, a similar encoder\u2013decoder model using two recursive neural networks was proposed in (Socher et al., 2011), but their model was restricted to a monolingual setting, i.e. the model reconstructs an input sentence. More recently, another encoder\u2013decoder model using an RNN was proposed in (Auli et al., 2013), where the decoder is conditioned on a representation of either a source sentence or a source context.\nOne important difference between the proposed RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder and the approaches in (Zou et al., 2013) and (Chandar et al., 2014) is that the order of the words in source and target phrases is taken into account. The RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder naturally distinguishes between sequences that have the same words but in a different order, whereas the aforementioned approaches effectively ignore order information.\nThe closest approach related to the proposed RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder is the Recurrent Continuous Translation Model (Model 2) proposed in (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013). In their paper, they proposed a similar model that consists of an encoder and decoder. The difference with our model is that they used a convolutional n-gram model (CGM) for the encoder and the hybrid of an inverse CGM and a recurrent neural network for the decoder. They, however, evaluated their model on rescoring the n-best list proposed by the conventional SMT system and computing the perplexity of the gold standard translations."

The bilingual corpora include Europarl (61M words), news commentary (5.5M), UN (421M), and two crawled corpora of 90M and 780M words respectively. The last two corpora are quite noisy. To train the French language model, about 712M words of crawled newspaper material is available in addition to the target side of the bitexts. All the word counts refer to French words after tokenization.\nIt is commonly acknowledged that training statistical models on the concatenation of all this data does not necessarily lead to optimal performance, and results in extremely large models which are difficult to handle. Instead, one should focus on the most relevant subset of the data for a given task. We have done so by applying the data selection method proposed in (Moore and Lewis, 2010), and its extension to bitexts (Axelrod et al., 2011). By these means we selected a subset of 418M words out of more than 2G words for language modeling and a subset of 348M out of 850M words for training the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder. We used the test set newstest2012 and 2013 for data selection and weight tuning with MERT, and newstest2014 as our test set. Each set has more than 70 thousand words and a single reference translation.\nFor training the neural networks, including the proposed RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder, we limited the source and target vocabulary to the most frequent 15,000 words for both English and French. This covers approximately 93% of the dataset. All the out-of-vocabulary words were mapped to a special token ([UNK]).\nThe baseline phrase-based SMT system was built using Moses with default settings.

Especially, the comparison between the SMT system using CSLM and that using the proposed approach of phrase scoring by RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder will clarify whether the contributions from multiple neural networks in different parts of the SMT sys-\ntem add up or are redundant. We trained the CSLM model on 7-grams from the target corpus. Each input word was projected into the embedding space R512, and they were concatenated to form a 3072- dimensional vector. The concatenated vector was fed through two rectified layers (of size 1536 and 1024) (Glorot et al., 2011). The output layer was a simple softmax layer (see Eq. (2)). All the weight parameters were initialized uniformly between \u22120.01 and 0.01, and the model was trained until the validation perplexity did not improve for 10 epochs. After training, the language model achieved a perplexity of 45.80. The validation set was a random selection of 0.1% of the corpus. The model was used to score partial translations during the decoding process, which generally leads to higher gains in BLEU score than n-best list rescoring (Vaswani et al., 2013).\nTo address the computational complexity of using a CSLM in the decoder a buffer was used to aggregate n-grams during the stacksearch performed by the decoder. Only when the buffer is full, or a stack is about to be pruned, the n-grams are scored by the CSLM.

For each such source phrase, we look at the target phrases that have been scored high either by the translation probability p(f | e) or by the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder. Similarly, we perform the same procedure with those pairs whose source phrase is long but rare in the corpus.\nTable 2 lists the top-3 target phrases per source phrase favored either by the translation model or by the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder.

We can observe that the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder prefers shorter phrases in general.\nInterestingly, many phrase pairs were scored similarly by both the translation model and the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder, but there were as many\nother phrase pairs that were scored radically different (see Fig. 3). This could arise from the proposed approach of training the RNN Encoder\u2013 Decoder on a set of unique phrase pairs, discouraging the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder from learning simply the frequencies of the phrase pairs from the corpus, as explained earlier.\nFurthermore, in Table 3, we show for each of the source phrases in Table 2, the generated samples from the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder.

We can see that the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder is able to propose well-formed target phrases without looking at the actual phrase table.

Along with the new architecture, we proposed a novel hidden unit that includes a reset gate and an update gate that adaptively control how much each hidden unit remembers or forgets while reading/generating a sequence.\nWe evaluated the proposed model with the task of statistical machine translation, where we used the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder to score each phrase pair in the phrase table. Qualitatively, we were able to show that the new model is able to capture linguistic regularities in the phrase pairs well and also that the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder is able to propose well-formed target phrases.\nThe scores by the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder were found to improve the overall translation performance in terms of BLEU scores. Also, we found that the contribution by the RNN Encoder\u2013 Decoder is rather orthogonal to the existing approach of using neural networks in the SMT system, so that we can improve further the performance by using, for instance, the RNN Encoder\u2013 Decoder and the neural net language model together.\nOur qualitative analysis of the trained model shows that it indeed captures the linguistic regularities in multiple levels i.e. at the word level as well as phrase level. This suggests that there may be more natural language related applications that may benefit from the proposed RNN Encoder\u2013 Decoder.\nThe proposed architecture has large potential for further improvement and analysis. One approach that was not investigated here is to replace the whole, or a part of the phrase table by letting the RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder propose target phrases. Also, noting that the proposed model is not limited to being used with written language, it will be an important future research to apply the proposed architecture to other applications such as speech transcription."

The hidden state at time t of the decoder is computed by\nh\u2032 \u3008t\u3009 j = z \u2032 jh \u2032\u3008t\u22121\u3009 j + (1\u2212 z \u2032 j)h\u0303\u2032 \u3008t\u3009 j ,\nwhere\nh\u0303\u2032 \u3008t\u3009 j =tanh ([ W\u2032e(yt\u22121) ] j + r\u2032j [ U\u2032h\u2032\u3008t\u22121\u3009 +Cc ]) ,\nz\u2032j =\u03c3 ([ W\u2032ze(yt\u22121) ] j + [ U\u2032zh \u2032 \u3008t\u22121\u3009 ] j + [Czc]j ) ,\nr\u2032j =\u03c3 ([ W\u2032re(yt\u22121) ] j + [ U\u2032rh \u2032 \u3008t\u22121\u3009 ] j + [Crc]j ) ,\nand e(y0) is an all-zero vector. Similarly to the case of the encoder, e(y) is an embedding of a target word.\nUnlike the encoder which simply encodes the source phrase, the decoder is learned to generate a target phrase. At each time t, the decoder computes the probability of generating j-th word by\np(yt,j = 1 | yt\u22121, . . . ,y1, X) = exp\n( gjs\u3008t\u3009 )\u2211K j\u2032=1 exp ( gj\u2032s\u3008t\u3009 ) ,\nwhere the i-element of s\u3008t\u3009 is\ns \u3008t\u3009 i = max { s\u2032 \u3008t\u3009 2i\u22121, s \u2032\u3008t\u3009 2i } and\ns\u2032 \u3008t\u3009 = Ohh \u2032\u3008t\u3009 +Oyyt\u22121 +Occ.\nIn short, the s\u3008t\u3009i is a so-called maxout unit. For the computational efficiency, instead of a single-matrix output weight G, we use a product of two matrices such that\nG = GlGr,\nwhere Gl \u2208 RK\u00d7500 and Gr \u2208 R500\u00d71000."
