    "abstractText": "We present a new method for synthesizing highresolution photo-realistic images from semantic label maps using conditional generative adversarial networks (conditional GANs). Conditional GANs have enabled a variety of applications, but the results are often limited to lowresolution and still far from realistic. In this work, we generate 2048 \u00d7 1024 visually appealing results with a novel adversarial loss, as well as new multi-scale generator and discriminator architectures. Furthermore, we extend our framework to interactive visual manipulation with two additional features. First, we incorporate object instance segmentation information, which enables object manipulations such as removing/adding objects and changing the object category. Second, we propose a method to generate diverse results given the same input, allowing users to edit the object appearance interactively. Human opinion studies demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, advancing both the quality and the resolution of deep image synthesis and editing. 1 ar X iv :1 71 1. 11 58 5v 2 [ cs .C V ] 2 0 A ug 2 01 8",

Conditional GANs have enabled a variety of applications, but the results are often limited to lowresolution and still far from realistic. In this work, we generate 2048 \u00d7 1024 visually appealing results with a novel adversarial loss, as well as new multi-scale generator and discriminator architectures. Furthermore, we extend our\nframework to interactive visual manipulation with two additional features. First, we incorporate object instance segmentation information, which enables object manipulations such as removing/adding objects and changing the object category. Second, we propose a method to generate diverse results given the same input, allowing users to edit the object appearance interactively. Human opinion studies demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, advancing both the quality and the resolution of deep image synthesis and editing.\n1"

            "text": "Photo-realistic image rendering using standard graphics techniques is involved, since geometry, materials, and light transport must be simulated explicitly. Although existing graphics algorithms excel at the task, building and editing virtual environments is expensive and time-consuming. That is because we have to model every aspect of the world explicitly. If we were able to render photo-realistic images using a model learned from data, we could turn the process of graphics rendering into a model learning and inference problem. Then, we could simplify the process of creating new virtual worlds by training models on new datasets. We could even make it easier to customize environments by allowing users to simply specify overall semantic structure rather than modeling geometry, materials, or lighting.\nIn this paper, we discuss a new approach that produces high-resolution images from semantic label maps. This method has a wide range of applications. For example, we can use it to create synthetic training data for training visual recognition algorithms, since it is much easier to create semantic labels for desired scenarios than to generate training images. Using semantic segmentation methods, we can transform images into a semantic label domain, edit the objects in the label domain, and then transform them back to the image domain. This method also gives us new tools for higher-level image editing, e.g., adding objects to images or changing the appearance of existing objects.\nTo synthesize images from semantic labels, one can use the pix2pix method, an image-to-image translation framework [21] which leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) [16] in a conditional setting. Recently, Chen and Koltun [5] suggest that adversarial training might be unstable and prone to failure for high-resolution image generation tasks. Instead, they adopt a modified perceptual loss [11, 13, 22] to synthesize images, which are highresolution but often lack fine details and realistic textures.\nHere we address two main issues of the above stateof-the-art methods: (1) the difficulty of generating highresolution images with GANs [21] and (2) the lack of details and realistic textures in the previous high-resolution results [5]. We show that through a new, robust adversarial learning objective together with new multi-scale generator and discriminator architectures, we can synthesize photo-realistic images at 2048 \u00d7 1024 resolution, which are more visually appealing than those computed by previous methods [5, 21]. We first obtain our results with adversarial training only, without relying on any hand-crafted losses [44] or pre-trained networks (e.g. VGGNet [48]) for perceptual losses [11, 22] (Figs. 9c, 10b). Then we show that adding perceptual losses from pre-trained networks [48] can slightly improve the results in some circumstances (Figs. 9d, 10c), if a pre-trained network is available. Both results outperform previous works substantially\nin terms of image quality. Furthermore, to support interactive semantic manipulation, we extend our method in two directions. First, we use instance-level object segmentation information, which can separate different object instances within the same category. This enables flexible object manipulations, such as adding/removing objects and changing object types. Second, we propose a method to generate diverse results given the same input label map, allowing the user to edit the appearance of the same object interactively.\nWe compare against state-of-the-art visual synthesis systems [5, 21], and show that our method outperforms these approaches regarding both quantitative evaluations and human perception studies. We also perform an ablation study regarding the training objectives and the importance of instance-level segmentation information. In addition to semantic manipulation, we test our method on edge2photo applications (Figs. 2,13), which shows the generalizability of our approach. Code and data are available at our website\n."

            "text": "Generative adversarial networks Generative adversarial networks (GANs) [16] aim to model the natural image distribution by forcing the generated samples to be indistinguishable from natural images. GANs enable a wide variety of applications such as image generation [1, 42, 62], representation learning [45], image manipulation [64], object detection [33], and video applications [38, 51, 54]. Various coarse-to-fine schemes [4] have been proposed [9,19,26,57] to synthesize larger images (e.g. 256 \u00d7 256) in an unconditional setting. Inspired by their successes, we propose a new coarse-to-fine generator and multi-scale discriminator architectures suitable for conditional image generation at a much higher resolution.\nImage-to-image translation Many researchers have leveraged adversarial learning for image-to-image translation [21], whose goal is to translate an input image from one domain to another domain given input-output image pairs as training data. Compared to L1 loss, which often\nleads to blurry images [21, 22], the adversarial loss [16] has become a popular choice for many image-to-image tasks [10, 24, 25, 32, 41, 46, 55, 60, 66]. The reason is that the discriminator can learn a trainable loss function and automatically adapt to the differences between the generated and real images in the target domain. For example, the recent pix2pix framework [21] used image-conditional GANs [39] for different applications, such as transforming Google maps to satellite views and generating cats from user sketches. Various methods have also been proposed to learn an image-to-image translation in the absence of training pairs [2, 34, 35, 47, 50, 52, 56, 65].\nRecently, Chen and Koltun [5] suggest that it might be hard for conditional GANs to generate high-resolution images due to the training instability and optimization issues. To avoid this difficulty, they use a direct regression objective based on a perceptual loss [11, 13, 22] and produce the first model that can synthesize 2048 \u00d7 1024 images. The generated results are high-resolution but often lack fine details and realistic textures. Motivated by their success, we show that using our new objective function as well as novel multiscale generators and discriminators, we not only largely stabilize the training of conditional GANs on high-resolution images, but also achieve significantly better results compared to Chen and Koltun [5]. Side-by-side comparisons clearly show our advantage (Figs. 1, 9, 8, 10).\nDeep visual manipulation Recently, deep neural networks have obtained promising results in various image processing tasks, such as style transfer [13], inpainting [41], colorization [58], and restoration [14]. However, most of these works lack an interface for users to adjust the current result or explore the output space. To address this issue, Zhu et al. [64] developed an optimization method for editing the object appearance based on the priors learned by GANs. Recent works [21, 46, 59] also provide user interfaces for creating novel imagery from low-level cues such as color and sketch. All of the prior works report results on low-resolution images. Our system shares the same spirit as this past work, but we focus on object-level semantic editing, allowing users to interact with the entire scene and manipulate individual objects in the image. As a result, users can quickly create a new scene with minimal effort. Our interface is inspired by prior data-driven graphics systems [6, 23, 29]. But our system allows more flexible manipulations and produces high-res results in real-time."

The framework operates in a supervised setting. In other words, the training dataset is given as a set of pairs of corresponding images {(si,xi)}, where si is a semantic label map and xi is a corresponding natural photo. Conditional GANs aim to model the conditional distribution of real images given the input semantic label maps via the following minimax game:\nmin G max D LGAN(G,D) (1)\nwhere the objective function LGAN (G,D) 1 is given by\nE(s,x)[logD(s,x)] + Es[log(1\u2212D(s, G(s))].

            "text": "We improve the pix2pix framework by using a coarse-tofine generator, a multi-scale discriminator architecture, and a robust adversarial learning objective function. Coarse-to-fine generator We decompose the generator into two sub-networks: G1 and G2. We term G1 as the global generator network and G2 as the local enhancer network. The generator is then given by the tuple G = {G1, G2} as visualized in Fig. 3. The global generator network operates at a resolution of 1024 \u00d7 512, and the local enhancer network outputs an image with a resolution that is 4\u00d7 the output size of the previous one (2\u00d7 along each image dimension). For synthesizing images at an even higher\n1we denote Es , Es\u223cpdata(s) and E(s,x) , E(s,x)\u223cpdata(s,x) for simplicity.\nresolution, additional local enhancer networks could be utilized. For example, the output image resolution of the generator G = {G1, G2} is 2048\u00d7 1024, and the output image resolution of G = {G1, G2, G3} is 4096\u00d7 2048.\nOur global generator is built on the architecture proposed by Johnson et al. [22], which has been proven successful for neural style transfer on images up to 512\u00d7 512. It consists of 3 components: a convolutional front-end G(F )1 , a set of residual blocks G(R)1 [18], and a transposed convolutional back-end G(B)1 . A semantic label map of resolution 1024\u00d7512 is passed through the 3 components sequentially to output an image of resolution 1024\u00d7 512.\nThe local enhancer network also consists of 3 components: a convolutional front-end G(F )2 , a set of residual blocks G(R)2 , and a transposed convolutional back-end G\n(B) 2 . The resolution of the input label map to G2 is 2048\u00d7 1024. Different from the global generator network, the input to the residual blockG(R)2 is the element-wise sum of two feature maps: the output feature map of G(F )2 , and the last feature map of the back-end of the global generator network G(B)1 . This helps integrating the global information from G1 to G2.\nDuring training, we first train the global generator and then train the local enhancer in the order of their resolutions. We then jointly fine-tune all the networks together. We use this generator design to effectively aggregate global and local information for the image synthesis task. We note that such a multi-resolution pipeline is a wellestablished practice in computer vision [4] and two-scale is often enough [3]. Similar ideas but different architectures could be found in recent unconditional GANs [9, 19] and conditional image generation [5, 57]. Multi-scale discriminators High-resolution image synthesis poses a significant challenge to the GAN discriminator design. To differentiate high-resolution real and synthesized images, the discriminator needs to have a large re-\nceptive field. This would require either a deeper network or larger convolutional kernels, both of which would increase the network capacity and potentially cause overfitting. Also, both choices demand a larger memory footprint for training, which is already a scarce resource for highresolution image generation.\nTo address the issue, we propose using multi-scale discriminators. We use 3 discriminators that have an identical network structure but operate at different image scales. We will refer to the discriminators as D1, D2 and D3. Specifically, we downsample the real and synthesized highresolution images by a factor of 2 and 4 to create an image pyramid of 3 scales. The discriminators D1, D2 and D3 are then trained to differentiate real and synthesized images at the 3 different scales, respectively. Although the discriminators have an identical architecture, the one that operates at the coarsest scale has the largest receptive field. It has a more global view of the image and can guide the generator to generate globally consistent images. On the other hand, the discriminator at the finest scale encourages the generator to produce finer details. This also makes training the coarse-to-fine generator easier, since extending a lowresolution model to a higher resolution only requires adding a discriminator at the finest level, rather than retraining from scratch. Without the multi-scale discriminators, we observe that many repeated patterns often appear in the generated images.\nWith the discriminators, the learning problem in Eq. (1) then becomes a multi-task learning problem of\nmin G max D1,D2,D3 \u2211 k=1,2,3 LGAN(G,Dk). (3)\nUsing multiple GAN discriminators at the same image scale has been proposed in unconditional GANs [12]. Iizuka et al. [20] add a global image classifier to conditional GANs to synthesize globally coherent content for inpainting. Here we extend the design to multiple discriminators at different\nimage scales for modeling high-resolution images. Improved adversarial loss We improve the GAN loss in Eq. (2) by incorporating a feature matching loss based on the discriminator. This loss stabilizes the training as the generator has to produce natural statistics at multiple scales. Specifically, we extract features from multiple layers of the discriminator and learn to match these intermediate representations from the real and the synthesized image. For ease of presentation, we denote the ith-layer feature extractor of discriminatorDk asD (i) k (from input to the ith layer ofDk). The feature matching loss LFM(G,Dk) is then calculated as: LFM(G,Dk) = E(s,x) T\u2211\ni=1\n1\nNi [||D(i)k (s,x)\u2212D (i) k (s, G(s))||1],\n(4) where T is the total number of layers and Ni denotes the number of elements in each layer. Our GAN discriminator feature matching loss is related to the perceptual loss [11, 13,22], which has been shown to be useful for image superresolution [32] and style transfer [22]. In our experiments, we discuss how the discriminator feature matching loss and the perceptual loss can be jointly used for further improving the performance. We note that a similar loss is used in VAEGANs [30].\nOur full objective combines both GAN loss and feature matching loss as:\nmin G\n(( max\nD1,D2,D3 \u2211 k=1,2,3\nLGAN(G,Dk) ) +\u03bb\n\u2211 k=1,2,3 LFM(G,Dk) ) (5)\nwhere \u03bb controls the importance of the two terms. Note that for the feature matching loss LFM, Dk only serves as a feature extractor and does not maximize the loss LFM."

            "heading": "3.3. Using Instance Maps",
            "text": "Existing image synthesis methods only utilize semantic label maps [5,21,25], an image where each pixel value represents the object class of the pixel. This map does not differentiate objects of the same category. On the other hand,\nan instance-level semantic label map contains a unique object ID for each individual object. To incorporate the instance map, one can directly pass it into the network, or encode it into a one-hot vector. However, both approaches are difficult to implement in practice, since different images may contain different numbers of objects of the same category. Alternatively, one can pre-allocate a fixed number of channels (e.g., 10) for each class, but this method fails when the number is set too small, and wastes memory when the number is too large.\nInstead, we argue that the most critical information the instance map provides, which is not available in the semantic label map, is the object boundary. For example, when objects of the same class are next to one another, looking at the semantic label map alone cannot tell them apart. This is especially true for the street scene since many parked cars or walking pedestrians are often next to one another, as shown in Fig. 4a. However, with the instance map, separating these objects becomes an easier task.\nTherefore, to extract this information, we first compute the instance boundary map (Fig. 4b). In our implementation, a pixel in the instance boundary map is 1 if its object ID is different from any of its 4-neighbors, and 0 otherwise. The instance boundary map is then concatenated with the one-hot vector representation of the semantic label map, and fed into the generator network. Similarly, the input to the discriminator is the channel-wise concatenation of instance boundary map, semantic label map, and the real/synthesized image. Figure 5b shows an example demonstrating the improvement by using object boundaries. Our user study in Sec. 4 also shows the model trained with instance boundary maps renders more photo-realistic object boundaries."

            "text": "Image synthesis from semantic label maps is a one-tomany mapping problem. An ideal image synthesis algorithm should be able to generate diverse, realistic images using the same semantic label map. Recently, several works learn to produce a fixed number of discrete outputs given the same input [5,15] or synthesize diverse modes controlled by a latent code that encodes the entire image [66]. Although\nthese approaches tackle the multi-modal image synthesis problem, they are unsuitable for our image manipulation task mainly for two reasons. First, the user has no intuitive control over which kinds of images the model would produce [5, 15]. Second, these methods focus on global color and texture changes and allow no object-level control on the generated contents.\nTo generate diverse images and allow instance-level control, we propose adding additional low-dimensional feature channels as the input to the generator network. We show that, by manipulating these features, we can have flexible control over the image synthesis process. Furthermore, note that since the feature channels are continuous quantities, our model is, in principle, capable of generating infinitely many images.\nTo generate the low-dimensional features, we train an encoder networkE to find a low-dimensional feature vector that corresponds to the ground truth target for each instance in the image. Our feature encoder architecture is a standard encoder-decoder network. To ensure the features are consistent within each instance, we add an instance-wise average pooling layer to the output of the encoder to compute the average feature for the object instance. The average feature is then broadcast to all the pixel locations of the instance. Figure 6 visualizes an example of the encoded features.\nWe replace G(s) with G(s, E(x)) in Eq. (5) and train the encoder jointly with the generators and discriminators. After the encoder is trained, we run it on all instances in the training images and record the obtained features. Then we perform aK-means clustering on these features for each semantic category. Each cluster thus encodes the features for a specific style, for example, the asphalt or cobblestone texture for a road. At inference time, we randomly pick one of the cluster centers and use it as the encoded features. These features are concatenated with the label map and used as the\ninput to our generator. We tried to enforce the KullbackLeibler loss [28] on the feature space for better test-time sampling as used in the recent work [66] but found it quite involved for users to adjust the latent vectors for each object directly. Instead, for each object instance, we present K modes for users to choose from."

We perform pairwise A/B tests deployed on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform on the Cityscapes dataset [7]. We follow the same experimental procedure as described in Chen and Koltun [5]. More specifically, two different kinds of experiments are conducted: unlimited time and limited time, as explained below.\nUnlimited time For this task, workers are given two images at once, each of which is synthesized by a different method for the same label map. We give them unlimited time to select which image looks more natural. The leftright order and the image order are randomized to ensure fair comparisons. All 500 Cityscapes test images are compared 10 times, resulting in 5, 000 human judgments for each method. In this experiment, we use the model trained on labels only (without instance maps) to ensure a fair comparison. Table 2 shows that both variants of our method outperform the other methods significantly.\nLimited time Next, for the limited time experiment, we compare our result with CRN and the original image (ground truth). In each comparison, we show results of two methods for a short period of time. We randomly select a duration between 1/8 seconds and 8 seconds, as adopted by prior work [5]. This evaluates how quickly the difference between the images can be perceived. Fig. 7 shows the comparison results at different time intervals. As the given time becomes longer and longer, the differences between these three types of images become more apparent and easier to observe. Figures 9 and 10 show some example results.\nAnalysis of the loss function We also study the importance of each term in our objective function using the unlimited time experiment. Specifically, our final loss contains three components: GAN loss, discriminator-based feature matching loss, and VGG perceptual loss. We compare our final implementation to the results using (1) only GAN loss, and (2) GAN + feature matching loss (i.e., without VGG loss). The obtained preference rates are 68.55% and 58.90%, respectively. As can be seen, adding the feature matching loss substantially improves the performance, while adding perceptual loss further enhances the results. However, note that using the perceptual loss is not critical, and we are still able to generate visually appealing results even without it (e.g., Figs. 9c, 10b).\nUsing instance maps We compare the results using instance maps to results without using them. We highlight the car regions in the images and ask the participants to choose which region looks more realistic. We obtain a preference rate of 64.34%, which indicates that using instance maps improves the realism of our results, especially around the object boundaries.\nAnalysis of the generator We compare results of different generators with all the other components fixed.
