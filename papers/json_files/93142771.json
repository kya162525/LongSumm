    "abstractText": "We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks. We show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static vectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance. We additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both task-specific and static vectors. The CNN models discussed herein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include sentiment analysis and question classification.",

            "text": "Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013) in recent years. Within natural language processing, much of the work with deep learning methods has involved learning word vector representations through neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Yih et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013) and performing composition over the learned word vectors for classification (Collobert et al., 2011). Word vectors, wherein words are projected from a sparse, 1-of-V encoding (here V is the vocabulary size) onto a lower dimensional vector space via a hidden layer, are essentially feature extractors that encode semantic features of words in their dimensions. In such dense representations, semantically close words are likewise close\u2014in euclidean or cosine distance\u2014in the lower dimensional vector space.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) utilize layers with convolving filters that are applied to\nlocal features (LeCun et al., 1998). Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved excellent results in semantic parsing (Yih et al., 2014), search query retrieval (Shen et al., 2014), sentence modeling (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), and other traditional NLP tasks (Collobert et al., 2011).\nIn the present work, we train a simple CNN with one layer of convolution on top of word vectors obtained from an unsupervised neural language model. These vectors were trained by Mikolov et al. (2013) on 100 billion words of Google News, and are publicly available.1 We initially keep the word vectors static and learn only the other parameters of the model. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, this simple model achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that the pre-trained vectors are \u2018universal\u2019 feature extractors that can be utilized for various classification tasks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning results in further improvements. We finally describe a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both pre-trained and task-specific vectors by having multiple channels.\nOur work is philosophically similar to Razavian et al. (2014) which showed that for image classification, feature extractors obtained from a pretrained deep learning model perform well on a variety of tasks\u2014including tasks that are very different from the original task for which the feature extractors were trained."

Let xi \u2208 Rk be the k-dimensional word vector corresponding to the i-th word in the sentence. A sentence of length n (padded where\n1https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\nar X\niv :1\n40 8.\n58 82\nv2 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n3 S\nep 2\n01 4\nnecessary) is represented as\nx1:n = x1 \u2295 x2 \u2295 . . .\u2295 xn, (1)\nwhere \u2295 is the concatenation operator. In general, let xi:i+j refer to the concatenation of words xi,xi+1, . . . ,xi+j . A convolution operation involves a filter w \u2208 Rhk, which is applied to a window of h words to produce a new feature. For example, a feature ci is generated from a window of words xi:i+h\u22121 by\nci = f(w \u00b7 xi:i+h\u22121 + b). (2)\nHere b \u2208 R is a bias term and f is a non-linear function such as the hyperbolic tangent. This filter is applied to each possible window of words in the sentence {x1:h,x2:h+1, . . . ,xn\u2212h+1:n} to produce a feature map\nc = [c1, c2, . . . , cn\u2212h+1], (3)\nwith c \u2208 Rn\u2212h+1. We then apply a max-overtime pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011) over the feature map and take the maximum value c\u0302 = max{c} as the feature corresponding to this particular filter. The idea is to capture the most important feature\u2014one with the highest value\u2014for each feature map. This pooling scheme naturally deals with variable sentence lengths.\nWe have described the process by which one feature is extracted from one filter. The model uses multiple filters (with varying window sizes) to obtain multiple features. These features form the penultimate layer and are passed to a fully connected softmax layer whose output is the probability distribution over labels.\nIn one of the model variants, we experiment with having two \u2018channels\u2019 of word vectors\u2014one\nthat is kept static throughout training and one that is fine-tuned via backpropagation (section 3.2).2 In the multichannel architecture, illustrated in figure 1, each filter is applied to both channels and the results are added to calculate ci in equation (2). The model is otherwise equivalent to the single channel architecture."

Gradients are backpropagated only through the unmasked units. At test time, the learned weight vectors are scaled by p such that w\u0302 = pw, and w\u0302 is used (without dropout) to score unseen sentences.

While we had expected performance gains through the use of pre-trained vectors, we were surprised at the magnitude of the gains. Even a simple model with static vectors (CNN-static) performs remarkably well, giving\ncompetitive results against the more sophisticated deep learning models that utilize complex pooling schemes (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) or require parse trees to be computed beforehand (Socher et al., 2013). These results suggest that the pretrained vectors are good, \u2018universal\u2019 feature extractors and can be utilized across datasets. Finetuning the pre-trained vectors for each task gives still further improvements (CNN-non-static)."

The results, however, are mixed, and further work on regularizing the fine-tuning process is warranted. For instance, instead of using an additional channel for the non-static portion, one could maintain a single channel but employ extra dimensions that are allowed to be modified during training."

For example, good is most similar to bad in word2vec, presumably because they are (almost) syntactically equivalent. But for vectors in the non-static channel that were finetuned on the SST-2 dataset, this is no longer the case (table 3). Similarly, good is arguably closer to nice than it is to great for expressing sentiment, and this is indeed reflected in the learned vectors.\nFor (randomly initialized) tokens not in the set of pre-trained vectors, fine-tuning allows them to learn more meaningful representations: the network learns that exclamation marks are associated with effusive expressions and that commas are conjunctive (table 3)."

For example, their Max-TDNN (Time Delay Neural Network) with randomly initialized words obtains 37.4% on the SST-1 dataset, compared to 45.0% for our model. We attribute such discrepancy to our CNN having much more capacity (multiple filter widths and feature maps).\n\u2022 Dropout proved to be such a good regularizer that it was fine to use a larger than necessary network and simply let dropout regularize it. Dropout consistently added 2%\u20134% relative performance.\n\u2022 When randomly initializing words not in word2vec, we obtained slight improvements by sampling each dimension from U [\u2212a, a] where a was chosen such that the randomly initialized vectors have the same variance as the pre-trained ones. It would be interesting to see if employing more sophisticated methods to mirror the distribution of pre-trained vectors in the initialization process gives further improvements.\n\u2022 We briefly experimented with another set of publicly available word vectors trained by Collobert et al. (2011) on Wikipedia,8 and found that word2vec gave far superior performance. It is not clear whether this is due to Mikolov et al.
